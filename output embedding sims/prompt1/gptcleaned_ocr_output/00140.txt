1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

A key aspect of interpersonal communication is defining uncertainty (Berger & Bradac, 1982). The concept originated in the theoretical framework of information theory, specifically in the work of Shannon and Weaver (1949). They proposed that uncertainty arises when a situation presents a high number of possible alternatives with relatively equal probabilities of occurrence. This view of uncertainty was initially related to the transmission of messages, but it also influenced the development of Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT). 

Berger and Calabrese (1975) integrated ideas from information theorists like Shannon and Weaver and Heider's (1958) research in attribution to adapt the concept of uncertainty to interpersonal communication. They defined uncertainty as the "number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The higher the level of uncertainty in a situation, the more challenging it becomes to predict behaviors and events. 

Uncertainty in interactions not only involves predicting present and past behaviors but also understanding why individuals behave or believe as they do. High levels of uncertainty can hinder relational development, causing stress, anxiety, and a decrease in communicator competence. This incompetence may prevent individuals from forming relationships or engaging in initial interactions. 

Reducing uncertainty is crucial for enhancing relationships, as it leads to increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, intimacy, and predictability in interactions. However, excessive certainty and predictability can also negatively impact a relationship, as noted by Heath and Bryant (2000). Despite individuals' efforts to decrease uncertainty, an excessive focus on certainty might hinder relationship growth by suppressing spontaneity and novelty.
