1. Return to Germany

The remaining unfinished papers were published without their permission and they realized it was their own work, in order to not jeopardize their return to Germany. In the latter part of his career, Adorno became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954, Adorno published a study result that had been done which warned against rigid institutionalization and psychological control. Adorno discussed the implications of mass culture and attempted to reshape the industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote about a universal pseudo-culture. Adorno conceded that film-making was part of the culture industry within society.

2. One-Dimensional Man and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context. Instead of culture serving ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms ensured the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society. Capitalist production and wealth kept society satisfied and quiescent. It was difficult for Marcuse to separate culture or mass media from society as a whole. He argued for the liberation of individuals from the dominating ideology. Marcuse's analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant ideology. In 1961, Friedrich Pollock reported to Adorno that individuals continued to receive revisions to the dominant ideology. Marcuse's theory could be translated into activism.
