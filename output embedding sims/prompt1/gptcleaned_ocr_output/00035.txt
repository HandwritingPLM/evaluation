CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding the public, and the necessary attention-generating propaganda in influencing society. Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase "the engineering of consent." He said, "Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and propaganda" (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays' theories also represent a different view of the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, "The public is not an amorphous mass which will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in "Public Relations" (1952). Rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 19..). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of society but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts being made by others and to persuade or suggest courses of action" (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not in such ignorance of public opinion. Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree on that point.

In conclusion, the importance of these theories lies in their ability to shed light on the manipulation of the public and the formation of public opinion. While these theories were formed years ago they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today and serve as a starting point for future research.
