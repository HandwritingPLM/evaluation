I. EARLY INFLUENCES

Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication:

Leon Festinger (1919-1985)
Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics. His influence can be seen in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975). Festinger's research further developed Lewin's theories and had a significant impact on the field of interpersonal communication and the development of Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT). Festinger's Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) explained how an imbalance among cognitions can affect individuals, leading to feelings of discomfort and the need for social comparison.

Fritz Heider (1896-1988)
Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in psychology in Europe, where he worked with renowned psychologists such as Wolfgang Kohler and Kurt Lewin. Heider acknowledged Lewin's stimulating influence, which is still evident in his work. In 1929, Heider moved to the United States and worked in Kansas for the remainder of his career.
