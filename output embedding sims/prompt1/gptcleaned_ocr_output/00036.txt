It is well accepted that communication transformed into mass communication research over the past 100 years. With the works of researchers like Becca Gare and others, higher conceptions of observational modes and media effects research emerged.

The usage of a functional approach in media sociology is suggested to have originated from the work of Blumler & Katz (1974). Functional theory aligns with media effects on people, such as the Hypodermic Syringe model, which suggests that mass media directly influences audiences by injecting information into their consciousness.

The exploration of gratifications motivating people's attraction to certain media is as old as empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). In the 1940s, researchers began studying soap operas and quizzes to understand the functions served by specific content or the medium itself.

Uses and gratifications approach became prevalent in the late 1950s to 1970s with the rise of television. Elihu Katz, a key figure in this field, has significantly contributed to shaping the approach through his work in both sociology and communication research.

Katz, mentored by Paul Lazarsfeld, connected gratifications research with the functional theory model. He introduced the notion that people use media for their benefit rather than being overwhelmed by it, emphasizing the active role of individuals in media consumption.

Katz and colleague Jay G. Blumler published essays on gratifications in 1974, exploring how media users seek out sources that fulfill their needs. They highlighted the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission in both society and individuals.
