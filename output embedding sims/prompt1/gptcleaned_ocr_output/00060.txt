4. CRITICAL RESPONSE TO “THE CULTURE INDUSTRY”

He complained to the dean about the radical students in his classes who were making teaching difficult. In the winter term of 1968-69, students occupied a hall at the University at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research. After it ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, including one "tasteless demonstration" in which three females bared their breasts. Adorno died a few months later (Jager, 2004, p. 201-08).

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since, there have been numerous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about "the commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production, and failed to examine the culture industry’s economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, believing that "capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification" (Eagleton, 1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that "the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the system as a whole" (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno’s idea of a culture industry was historically limited since the society that developed in the 1960s and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s. While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial societies between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 146-48). Thus, for some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.

Thus, for some critics, modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology and, hence, society. Since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culture industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. It is nonetheless the case that motion pictures are still made by large companies and that their movies largely rely on formulaic plots. It is also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by an oligopoly of companies, which tend to impose restrictions on how stations operate. As a broadcast medium, television is very much related to both radio and film and shares with those media the situation it in the culture industry. While there is a democratizing aspect (in that anyone can create a website), it happens that the dominant voices on the Internet continue to maintain an ideological function. Rare are new stories on MSNBC or Yahoo that would question the prerogatives of corporate America.

A reexamination of the idea of the culture industry may be necessary to understand how mass communication media propagate commodified aesthetics.
