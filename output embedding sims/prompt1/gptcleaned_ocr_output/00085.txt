Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding the public and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda is crucial in influencing public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself emphasized the importance of careful planning in modern public relations, rather than relying on hit or miss publicity and propaganda. Furthermore, Bernays' theories offer a different perspective on the formation of public opinion compared to Lippmann. He cautions against viewing the public as easily manipulated and instead suggests that businesses should strive to establish amicable and beneficial partnerships with the public.

In his work "Public Relations" (1952), Bernays presents public relations as a tool for aligning the ideas of the public and the persuader, helping both parties adjust to the contemporary situation. While acknowledging the power of society, Bernays also acknowledges the possibility of manipulating the public. He highlights the importance of public relations in helping citizens understand society, evaluate different viewpoints, and suggest courses of action.

The theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays hold significance for understanding the influence of media on the public. These theories have paved the way for research on media effects and the understanding of agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming. While some theorists like Ellul emphasize direct effects of media, others like Lippmann acknowledge the limited effects of media on shaping public opinion. Overall, the insights provided by these scholars continue to be relevant in comprehending modern society.
