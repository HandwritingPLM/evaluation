1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Needs and Gratifications approach emerged in media research by Blumler and Katz (1974) who identified four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotional stability of "growth" and "preservation." When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use.

Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status;
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

McQuail's (1983) classification includes common reasons for media use:

1. Finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world
2. Seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision choice
3. Satisfying curiosity and general interest
4. Learning; self-education
5. Gaining a sense of security through knowledge
6. Finding reinforcement for personal value
7. Finding models of behavior
8. Understanding and identifying with valued others (in the media)
9. Gaining insight into oneself
