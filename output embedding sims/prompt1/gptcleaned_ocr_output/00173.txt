Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to understand the concept of the culture industry, its origins, development and impact need to be explored. The idea of the culture industry, which is rooted in popular culture, was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923 and later expanded upon by Theodor Adorno. Adorno's relationship with Benjamin greatly influenced his thinking, especially during their time at the Institute in Frankfurt. Adorno's teaching career was disrupted by the Nazis in 1933, leading him to work at the Institute's branch in Geneva, Switzerland.

Adorno's experiences during this time, including his study of mass culture in the United States, shaped his critical theory. His skepticism towards mass culture was evident as he observed the increasing influence of propaganda and entertainment in the 1930s. Adorno's views on mechanical reproduction, particularly in music, differed from Benjamin's more optimistic perspective.

Adorno's time at the Princeton Radio Research Project in the United States further solidified his disillusionment with the commercialization of culture. Despite his initial confusion about working on a "radio project," Adorno's expertise on music proved valuable in critiquing the role of radio in bringing serious music to the masses. Adorno's critical stance on mass culture and the culture industry was in line with the Frankfurt School's overall approach, as seen in his writings and work during this period.
