Generating propaganda in influencing the masses is a strategic communication tool used to shape public opinion. Edward Bernays, a pioneer in public relations, emphasized the importance of careful planning and ethical communication in the field of propaganda. Unlike Walter Lippmann, who believed that public opinion could be manipulated, Bernays cautioned against such tactics and advocated for transparency and mutual understanding between organizations and the public. He believed that public relations should be used to explain a company's goals and objectives in terms that the public can understand, rather than manipulating their perceptions.

Bernays' view of public relations as a means of facilitating communication and understanding between organizations and the public is in contrast to Lippmann's more cynical view of mass manipulation. While Bernays acknowledged the potential for manipulation, he believed that public relations could serve as a valuable tool for promoting understanding and dialogue between organizations and the public. This more nuanced view of public relations has influenced modern research on the role of media in shaping public opinion.

In conclusion, the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays have played a significant role in shaping our understanding of the media's influence on public opinion. While Lippmann and Ellul focused on the potentially manipulative power of the media, Bernays emphasized the importance of ethical communication and mutual understanding between organizations and the public. These theories have informed contemporary research on media effects and have helped us better understand the complex relationship between the media, public opinion, and society.
