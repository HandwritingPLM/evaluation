Propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97).

Regarding the value of empirical studies, Adorno's work at the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually inspire him to further develop the idea of the culture industry.

Commercialization of culture in both Germany and the United States had surpassed anything previously seen. Adorno noted that the advertising industry in the United States was unparalleled. He later referenced his experience with the Project in his essay on the culture industry, highlighting the statistical research conducted and its resemblance to political propaganda.

Lazarsfeld and Adorno parted ways due to dissatisfaction. Adorno could not join Horkheimer in California until November 1941. Upon relocating, he engaged with an expatriate community in California, where his interactions influenced his thoughts on culture, particularly due to the Hollywood system and the freedom experienced in Weimar Germany.

Adorno's interest in music, friendship with Benjamin, involvement with the Princeton Radio Project, and connections to the Hollywood film industry all contributed to his concerns about the culture industry and mass deception.

According to Adorno, popular culture in film and radio did not solely entertain but also served as an ideology perpetuating capitalism. The business model based on mass production methods paralleled those in the industrial domain, leading to homogeneous content generation and hindering true dissent against the system.

The culture industry, characterized by formulaic production and mechanical reproduction, restricted genuine creativity, and became a tool of social control. Adorno viewed high art and avant-garde expressions as the adversaries of the culture industry, as they were intended for mass consumption and lacked the critical edge needed to challenge the dominant system.
