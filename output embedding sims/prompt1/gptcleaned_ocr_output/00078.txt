1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

The study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 provided five basic assumptions about the relationship between media and audiences:

1. The audience is viewed as active, meaning that mass media use is goal oriented and shaped by expectations of what content offers the audience.
 
2. In the mass communication process, the audience member takes the initiative in linking need gratification and media choice, which limits a straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and behavior.
 
3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction as mass communication serves only a segment of human needs.
 
4. Many goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves, showing self-awareness of interests and motives.
 
5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while exploring audience orientations.

Additionally, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch noted the importance of uses and gratifications research in understanding the diverse gratifications that attract people to the media. They highlighted aspects such as social and psychological origins of needs, expectations of mass media, and differential exposure leading to need gratification and unintended consequences.

The research on needs and gratifications has evolved since Katz's analysis, particularly in the context of new media forms in the electronic information age. The approach emphasizes motives and individual differences in media use based on needs, social situations, and backgrounds.

Different people use media content for various purposes, with media gratifying different needs for individuals. The motivation for media use varies among users, and audience members are able to articulate their own motives and gratifications in using different media.
