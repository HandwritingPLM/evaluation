Returning without addition: 

Published with permission in 1941, Volume 1 emphasizes the importance of work in order to ensure the safe return to Germany. In the 1940s, the Institute relocated to Frankfurt and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer returned to Frankfurt, and in 1954 Adorno published an essay on television, which resulted from a study involving Gerbner and others. Adorno discussed the transformation of modern mass culture into psychological control by the culture industry. 

Marcuse analyzed late capitalist society in a systematic context, emphasizing social control mechanisms and the integration of individuals into mass society. He questioned the differentiation between information/entertainment and manipulation/indoctrination in mass media. Unlike Adorno, Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass media as separate entities from dominant ideology, leading to a pessimistic outlook on society.

In 1961, Friedrich Pollack informed Adorno and Horkheimer that their text needed significant revision for widespread dissemination. Negotiations with the Fischer publishing house continued until 1969, with concerns over pirate copies already in circulation.
