The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since then, there have been numerous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about “the commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods.” For the generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising.

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, believing that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification.” Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the system as a whole.” Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno’s idea of a culture industry was historically limited since the society that developed in the 1960s and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s. While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial societies between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness. Thus, for some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would be necessary to aggregate dominant ideologies.
