Needs and Gratifications

Uses and Gratifications

Motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members concluded that different people can use the same communication message as there are media. Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background such as education affect people's ideas about what they want from media and why they use it. There are as many reasons, experiences, interests, and interactions to classify four important motivations for using media: personal problems; emotional release; identity; self-reference; reality seeking.

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then, he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotion stability of "growth" and "preservation." When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use. Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Personal utility gratifications: (1) Diversion; (2) Personal relationships; time spent; and surveillance (forms of information seeking).
2. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding.
3. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, and feelings.
4. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status.
5. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends, and tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Consequently, McQuail's (1983) classification of common reasons for media use includes: finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world; seeking advice on practical matters or opinions and decision choices; satisfying curiosity and general interest; learning; self-education; gaining a sense of security through knowledge; finding reinforcement for personal values; finding models of behavior; identifying with valued others (in the media); gaining insight into oneself.
