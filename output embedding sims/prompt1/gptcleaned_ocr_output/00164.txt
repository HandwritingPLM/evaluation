Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure in linguistics. Signifying operates on two levels, the systematic area which is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 1967). In contrast to language, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form, called the signifier. The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form operates in an arbitrary relation. Meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic.

For example, the sentence "I went to a theater with my girlfriend" is established through the combination of signs. Signs generate meaning through their relations to each other, not the reference to external entities. Signs are organized through cultural conventions within a particular context.
