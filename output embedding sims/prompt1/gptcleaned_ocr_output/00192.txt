After initially working at the University of Rochester, Festinger followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics in 1945. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research. Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal communication and the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Festinger received the Distinguished Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology.
