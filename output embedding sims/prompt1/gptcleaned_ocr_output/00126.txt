1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange, in which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty, is a basic human function. Uncertainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that reducing uncertainty was a central motive. Berger and Calabrese (1975) note: "One of the motivations underlying interpersonal communication is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty" (p. 153). The study of information is basic to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical research in the field of interpersonal communication.

Through the development of URT, these scholars examined the significant relationship in uncertainty reduction underpinning interpersonal communication. Berger and Calabrese (1975) have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal communication process, marking the emergence of URT in the field of interpersonal communication. The research underlying the theoretical approaches founded in other social sciences, as starting points. Heath and Bryant (2000) state, "[...] rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social psychological theories [...]"

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field most often linked to studies into language, social cognition, and social psychology. Interpersonal communication is a central term because scholars adopted communication as the field of interpersonal communication, as they wanted to study it as a significant and unique aspect of human behavior.

Prior to the 1960s, only a modest amount of research was completed under the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant (2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication. Particularly since 1960, research trends in humanistic psychology and existentialism inspired the idea that relationships could be improved through effective.
