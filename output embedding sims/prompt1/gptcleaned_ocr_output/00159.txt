It is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology over the past 100 years. With valuable ideas and exploring untapped fields in these disciplines, researchers have elicited a series of higher conceptions for understanding media. As a sub-tradition of media effects research, the uses and gratifications approach is suggested to have originated from a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). Functional theory, to some extent, aligns with the effects of media on people. For example, the commonly used Hypodermic Syringe model in the theory proposes that mass media have a direct, immediate, and influential effect on audiences by injecting information into the consciousness of the masses (Watson & Hill, 1997, p. 105). Functional theory influenced communication studies from the 1920s to the 1940s. Afterward, a shift that rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred, leading to the establishment of the uses and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Research dating back to the 1940s delved into the reasons for viewing different radio programs, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well as daily newspapers (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948). These studies identified a list of functions served by specific content or the medium itself (Katz et al., 1974b). For example, radio soap operas were found to provide listeners with advice, support, or emotional release, while newspapers offered readers a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and a structured daily routine. This varied usage led psychologist Herzog (1944) to term them "gratifications."

The uses and gratifications approach gained popularity from the late 1950s to the 1970s with the rise of television. Elihu Katz, a prominent scholar in this approach, significantly contributed to its establishment. Katz, who holds a Ph.D. in Sociology, began teaching in the field of communication research. He conducted extensive work on mass media, television, and their influence on culture and communication from the 1970s to the 1990s. Katz has been instrumental in linking gratifications research with functional theory, emphasizing that individuals use media to their benefit. Katz's collaboration with Jay G. Blumler led to the publication of essays on gratifications in 1974, titled "The Uses of Mass Communication," where they highlighted the humanistic approach to media consumption. They found that media serves functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission for both society and individuals.
