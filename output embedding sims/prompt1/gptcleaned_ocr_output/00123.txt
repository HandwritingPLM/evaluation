1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motivation. Blumler and Katz (1974) highlighted the self-perceived needs of audience members for very different purposes. The same needs can be seen as unique to individuals. There is not only one way that individuals use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for media use as there are media users. Social situations, individual characteristics, and the individualâ€™s background, such as experience, interests, and people's ideas about what they want from media, determine which media best meet their needs. Members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person" to classify four important media gratifications: diversion, personal relationships, personal identity, and surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another version of audience motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between cognitive and affective needs and added dimensions like active versus passive initiation, external versus internal goal orientation, and emotional stability of growth versus preservation. When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use. Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and categorized them into cognitive needs, affective needs, personal integrative needs, social integrative needs, and tension release needs.

McQuail (1983) classified common reasons for media use as finding out about relevant events and conditions in the immediate surroundings, seeking advice on practical matters, satisfying curiosity and general interest, education, security through knowledge, learning, gaining a sense of security, finding reinforcement for personal values and behavior, finding models in others in the media, identifying with valued others, and gaining insight into oneself.
