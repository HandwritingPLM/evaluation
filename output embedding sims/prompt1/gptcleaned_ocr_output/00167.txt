Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing about propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analysis. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining (Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda, conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is known for pioneering the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis is defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into ificati in order to measure tain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication," Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which symbols try to persuade the audienceâ€™s opinion, and the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to achieve the goal of understanding the stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content to audience" (p. 74).

Throughout the remainder of his career, Lasswell was primarily interested in examining the effects of the media on public opinion. In this way, Lasswell has created a cycle whereby the public is both influenced by propaganda and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still essential that information is presented to the public in a fair and unbiased way, upholding the principles of the democratic system.

Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Harold Lasswell were active, Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations. He defines propaganda as a consistent and enduring effort to shape public opinion.
