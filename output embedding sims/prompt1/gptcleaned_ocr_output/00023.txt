1. RETURN TO GERMANY

When their works were published without permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested and distanced themselves from their own work to avoid jeopardizing their return to Germany. The Institute relocated to Frankfurt in the late 1940s and opened in new premises in 1951. Horkheimer became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954, Adorno published an essay titled "How to Look at Television," which was the result of a study done for the Hacker Foundation with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. Adorno warned in this essay that rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of psychological control. It was one of the few times in the 1950s that Adorno discussed the implications of mass culture. Some found it odd that the leading cultural theorist did not engage in the cultural developments of the fifties. Adorno did, however, occasionally try to reshape his thoughts on the culture industry. For example, in 1959, he wrote about a universal pseudo-culture in the United States and later gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on "The Culture Industry Reconsidered." In 1966, while writing the essay "Transparencies on Film," Adorno acknowledged that film-making might be acceptable cultural practice against the culture industry within the context of modernism.

2. ONE-DIMENSIONAL MAN AND SUPPRESSION OF THE CULTURE INDUSTRY

Marcuse provided an analysis of late capitalist society within a systematic context, unlike other Frankfurt School writers. He believed that social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society aimed to integrate individuals into mass society. Capitalist production and resulting wealth formed a system of repressive affluence that kept society elements content and obedient. Society was organized around an ideology to maintain social control and perpetuate dominant ideology. Marcuse questioned if mass media could separate information and entertainment from manipulation and indoctrination functions. His analysis did not separate culture or mass media from society as Adorno did, leading to no opposition to the dominant ideology. Marcuse pondered on how individuals could liberate themselves from their masters and break the vicious circle. Despite the pessimistic tone of his book, he became an icon for leftist movements of the 1960s in the U.S. and Germany. Marcuse considered himself a philosopher, not an activist, like others from the Frankfurt School who were cautious about translating theory into practice.

Reviewing the text in 1961, Friedrich Pollack informed Adorno and Horkheimer that the work needed extensive revision for mass dissemination. The authors negotiated with the Fischer publishing house until 1969 and may have agreed to republish the work due to existing pirated copies.
