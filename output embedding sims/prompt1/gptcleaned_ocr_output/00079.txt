1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning theories, dissonance, balance, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the 1970s and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and others emerged, along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and others. Berger (2005) states: "these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is central in our understanding of interpersonal processes.

1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver also contributed to the development of information theory as well as Heider's research in attribution theory. They expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by considering the "number of alternative ways in which an event exists in a situation, the smaller the level of uncertainty there might behave" (p. 100).

The greater the uncertainty, the more difficult it is to predict behaviors. Individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac (1982) highlighted the complexity of this process when they defined uncertainty as "how a stranger might behave" (p. 100).

Higher levels of uncertainty can cause stress and anxiety, which may severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can also lead to low levels of certainty (West & Turner, 2000). Incompetent communicators may not be able to engage in initial interactions effectively. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty can lead to increased intimacy, likability, and predictability with the goal of reducing uncertainty. However, it can be difficult to reach this goal in interpersonal interactions.

Individuals are expected to reveal information gradually in interactions, hoping that this will lead to increased predictability and a sense of certainty. When high uncertainty exists, interaction may become strained. Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty and predictability can also inhibit a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) state that too much certainty and predictability can deaden a relationship.

Uncertainty is an important aspect of interpersonal communication that plays a significant role in relationship development. It can either facilitate or hinder the process of forming strong connections.
