1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows. They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of mass media use is assumed to be goal-oriented... patterns of media use are shaped by more or less definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience member.

2. The audience plays a significant role in linking need gratification and media choice. This places a strong limitation on theorizing about any straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by mass communication are just a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the extent to which they can be met through mass media consumption varies.

4. Many of the goals of mass media use can be derived methodologically from data provided by individual audience members themselves - people are self-aware enough to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when presented in a familiar verbal formulation.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be set aside while exploring audience orientations on their own terms (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch commented that previous research on gratifications identified various attractions of the media for people but did not address the connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They proposed that uses and gratifications research should consider the social and psychological origins of needs that lead to expectations of mass media or other sources, resulting in differential exposure and need gratification with other unintended consequences (Katz et al., 1974b, p. 20).

The theoretical foundation of the uses and gratifications approach was laid by Katz and his colleagues. Research on this subject has since been expanded, especially with the emergence of new media forms in the electronic information age, offering more options for media use. 

Uses and gratifications approach focuses on the motives and self-perceived needs of audience members. Individual motivations for using media may vary, and the same message can fulfill different needs for different individuals. People use media for a multitude of reasons, influenced by basic needs, social situations, and personal background such as experience, interests, and education (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Audience members are aware of and can articulate their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) categorized four essential media gratifications in their model of "media-person interactions."
