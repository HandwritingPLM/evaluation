1 Other Propaganda Theorists
1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

Procedure of content analysis Rogers. 1994). Generally, content analysis can be defined as, "the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications in order to measure certain variables" 

(Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication," Rogers argued that content analysis should take into account the frequency with which a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience’s opinion, and understanding the content of the message. Lasswell (1946) aims to achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence runs from sea that runs from control to content and from content."

His method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell's (1953) early definition of communication which stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 84). Content analysis was essentially the "says what" part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them, and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and sent were Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public relations. He defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the public of an enterprise, ideology, or group (p. 25) can proponents decide what is beneficial or harmful to the public.

He states that this may not always be beneficial to society's functioning as we are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of... Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live in society (p. 9).

Bernays believed that public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is essential to his work in the field of public relations.
