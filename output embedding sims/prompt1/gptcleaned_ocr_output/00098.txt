CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States and the prevalence of advertising in media was something with no correlative experience to the advertising industry in the United States. Adorno was later to allude to his experience in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical research as being indistinguishable from political. It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not agree on empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University led to his delayed move to the West Coast until he joined an expatriate community including Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Doblin, and others who worked in the Hollywood movie industry. Adorno's interest in music, friendship with Benjamin, work on the Princeton Project, and involvement with the expatriate community are crucial to his concern for the culture industry.

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. Instead, it was a business that legitimized intentionally produced trash as an ideology. This business was based on Fordist capitalism, implementing mass production techniques and centralization. Examples of this included the Hollywood production system and the CBS radio network. Adorno argued that movies and songs were formulaic, suppressing real creativity, and reinforcing the system. Adorno criticized high art for being a defender against popular culture without offering a true alternative. Instead, he viewed avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry, rejecting a Marxist analysis.
