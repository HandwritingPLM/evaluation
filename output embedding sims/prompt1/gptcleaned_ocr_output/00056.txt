Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the genesis and development of the concept of the culture industry as well as its reception, the concept can be traced logically from its preconditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frankfurt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late 1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. 

While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the essence of artistic authenticity. Adorno strongly condemned the mechanical reproduction of music, as he believed it diminished the authenticity of the original work. The general attitude of the Frankfurt School was that of Adorno.

In 1941, Adorno obtained a position at the Princeton Radio Research Project through his colleague Lazarsfeld. Adorno questioned the commercialization of culture in the United States and expressed skepticism towards the claims made by the radio industry.
