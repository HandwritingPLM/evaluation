Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of these theories is crucial for the public, and the application (Bernays, 55). Bernays (1955) himself emphasized the importance of attention-generating propaganda in influencing the engineering of consent. Engineering implies careful planning, distinguishing modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity (Bernays, 1952). Furthermore, Bernays' theories offer a different view of public opinion compared to Lippmann. Bernays warns against easily manipulating the public, stating that it is not an amorphous mass that can be molded at will (Bernays, 1928). Instead, he suggests that a business must understand and communicate with the public in terms they can comprehend and accept.

Bernays elaborates on these concepts in his book "Public Relations" (1952), emphasizing that public relations can combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. While acknowledging the power of society, Bernays still recognizes the possibility of manipulating the public. He argues that public relations is important for citizens to understand society better and evaluate viewpoints (Bernays, 1952). Despite the potential for manipulation, theorists like Lippmann and Ellul disagreed with some of Bernays' points.

Based on the ideas of Lippmann, Ellul, and Bernays, recent research has focused on understanding the media's influence on the public. Iyengar, Kinder, White, Lewin, McCombs, and Shaw have expanded on concepts like agenda-setting and priming to shed light on how media can affect audiences. While some theorists, like Bilal, emphasize direct effects, others acknowledge the limited effects of media on public opinion. Overall, the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul are essential for comprehending the media's role in society and public manipulation.
