1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows. They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of mass media use is assumed to be goal-oriented... patterns of media use are shaped by more or less definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience member.

In the mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and behavior.

The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by Mass Communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption certainly varies.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - i.e., people are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms.

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the connections between these gratifications, they did not address the Cations research concerned with the following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2) needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif s), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other nded ones”. The studies of Katz and foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach has been strengthened and extended on Katz’s first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in the electronic information age when people have ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), perhaps mostly unintended consequences.

Since the research on this subject, the current status of uses and gratifications is still based on particularly as new media forms have emerged in such ane € more options of media use.

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different Sage for very different purposes individuals, There is not only one way that people use for using the media as there are media users.
