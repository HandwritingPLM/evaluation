Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels: the systematic system and the variation by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signal that composes it. On the other hand, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 1967, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structural level, langue, is the social convention or value shared through society, which is stabilized and standardized. In contrast, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract that one must accept entirely to communicate. Because language is a system of contractual values, it resists modifications from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the language code to express personal thoughts. Speech corresponds to an individual act of combination, not pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through a form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. The correspondence between the concept/meaning and the external form is arbitrary rather than destined. It is the difference between signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure argues that language constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences. Meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along the syntagmatic (e.g., a sentence) and paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms) axes, organized into a signifying system (Barker, 2002, p. 29).

As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting signs within the same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of the linguistic community members. Signs generate meaning by reference to each other through social conventions organized through the relations between signs (Barker, Gay 2002, p. 29). Saussure argues that signs make sense through their relations with other signs within a sequence that generates meaning through cultural conventions in a particular context.
