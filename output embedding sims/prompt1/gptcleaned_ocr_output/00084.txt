I am fascinated by Saussure's structural linguistics.

Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's linguistic theory. According to Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels: the systematic system, called langue, and the variation called parole. Langue is the systematized set of underlying principles that govern language and is essential for communication. In contrast, parole refers to the individual speech acts that reflect personal expression. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within a social context, where langue represents the social conventions shared by society, while parole embodies individual flexibility within these constraints.

Language is viewed as a social institution and a system of values. It is a collective contract that individuals must accept entirely to communicate effectively. Language resists individual modifications and is considered a social institution due to its structured nature. In contrast, speech is an individual act that involves the selection and actualization of language codes to express personal thoughts. Speech is a combinative activity that relies on the shared conventions of language, distinguishing it from pure creation.

Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified represents the concept or meaning, while the signifier is the external form of language. The relationship between the concept and its external form is arbitrary rather than predetermined, operating within a system of differences. Meaning is constructed through the selection and combination of signs along syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes, organized into a signifying system. Signs generate meaning through their relationships with one another, guided by cultural conventions and linguistic community consensus.

Saussure's argument emphasizes that signs derive meaning from their relations with other signs rather than reference to external objects. Meaning is a social convention organized through the interrelations of signs within a particular context. This understanding underscores the significance of differences between signs in generating meaning and the importance of cultural conventions in shaping linguistic expression.
