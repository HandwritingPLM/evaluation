As one of the structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. This mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized area of communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which conveys it; speech (parole) covers the purely individual aspect. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. Langue is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized.

On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. It is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the. A language is therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language; it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not in the destined relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. According to Saussure, "meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system."

Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when they are related to each other. Saussure argues that meaning is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs.
