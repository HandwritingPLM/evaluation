1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 outlined five basic assumptions in their study of the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is perceived as active, with the use of mass media assumed to be goal-oriented and shaped by expectations.
2. Much of the initiative in linking need gratification and media choice is with the audience member, limiting theorizing about the direct effects of media content.
3. The media competes with other sources of need satisfaction, catering only to a segment of human needs.
4. Goals of mass media use can be derived from individual audience members themselves, showing self-awareness in reporting interests and motives.
5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while exploring audience orientations on their own terms.

Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also mentioned the importance of researching the connections between different gratifications that attract people to media content, emphasizing the social and psychological origins of needs, expectations of media, engagement in activities, need gratification, and unintended consequences.

The uses and gratifications approach focuses on motives and self-perceived needs of audience members, suggesting that different people may use the same communication message for varying purposes and that media content may gratify different needs for different individuals.

Individual backgrounds such as experience, interests, and education influence people's ideas about their media needs, allowing audience members to be aware of their motives and gratifications. Quail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of four critical media gratifications known as the "media-person interactions."
