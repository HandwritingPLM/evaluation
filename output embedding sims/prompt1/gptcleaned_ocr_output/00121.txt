It is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology, illuminated by valuable ideas and exploring untapped fields in higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of media effects research, the uses and gratifications approach is suggested to have originally stemmed from a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, functional theory on communication aligns with media's effects on people. For example, the Hypodermic Syringe model, often used in the theory, discusses how mass media can have a direct, immediate, and influential effect on audiences by injecting information into their consciousness (Watson & Hill 1997, p. 105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s, leading to the emergence of the uses and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to consume certain media is nearly as old as empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became interested in the reasons for consuming different radio programs, soap operas, quizzes, and daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948, etc.). Researchers discovered various functions served either by specific content or the medium itself (Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to provide listeners with advice, support, or emotional release, while newspapers were important for giving readers a sense of security, topics for conversation, and structure in their routines (Berelson, 1949).

The uses and gratifications approach became prevalent from the late 1950s to the 1970s as television grew. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed during this era, with contributions from scholars like Elihu Katz, who played a significant role in shaping the approach.

Elihu Katz served as both a sociologist and communication researcher, receiving his Ph.D. in Sociology from Columbia University in 1956 and teaching at various universities. Katz, along with Jay G. Blumler, published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 entitled "The Uses of Mass Communication", advocating for a humanistic approach to media use and highlighting the functions media serves for society and individuals.
