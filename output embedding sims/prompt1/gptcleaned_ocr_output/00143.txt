He complained to the dean about the radicalism in his teaching, specifically students in his classes that were part of the 1968-69 student occupation, including Adorno. After the strike ended, Adorno's lectures continued to be disrupted, including an incident a few months later where three females bared their breasts. Adorno died shortly after.

The 1972 English-language critique of the culture industry brought various criticisms of the text, especially Adorno's sweeping statements about the commodified and fetishized nature of cultural goods. Deborah Cook critiqued Adorno for not discussing the processes of cultural production and the industry's economic dependencies. Terry Eagleton believed Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, while Fredric Jameson pointed out the historical limitations of Adorno's idea of the culture industry.

Some critics argue that modernist works could counteract the dominant ideology, but it's also possible for the dominant ideology to co-opt modernist works. Despite the critiques, the idea of the culture industry has been important in critical theory since the 1940s, leading to discussions about mass communication and society. A reexamination of the concept may shed light on how mass media propagates dominant ideologies.
