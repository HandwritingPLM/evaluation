Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics.

According to Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two axes: langue and parole. The former is called langue and pertains to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal itself; as opposed to it, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimensions: langue is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level; it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. Language is a system of contractual values that resists modifications coming from a single individual, making it a social institution. In contrast, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization, corresponding to an individual act and not a pure creation.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form, while the form is the signifier, the external part of language. For example, both the word "dog" in English or in Korean are external forms expressing the actual animal dog. The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is in the arbitrary relation, and not in the destined relation. Meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, organized into a signifying system.

Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us how they are related to each other, and meaning is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs.
