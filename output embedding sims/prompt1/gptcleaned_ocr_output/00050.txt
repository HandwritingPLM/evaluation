1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows:
1. The audience is conceived as active and assumed to be goal-oriented.
2. Members have definite expectations of what they want from the media.
3. Patterns of media use are shaped by certain kinds of content.
4. Media choice lies with the audience, linking need gratification and behavior.
5. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction.

Methodologically, most of the goals of mass media use can be derived from individual audience members. People are self-aware enough to report their interests and motives. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored.

Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also noted that previous research on gratifications did not address the connections between them. They proposed that uses and gratifications research should focus on the social and psychological origins of needs that generate expectations of the mass media. The studies by Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation, leading to strengthened and extended research in this area.

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. People can use the same communication message for different purposes. Media content may satisfy different needs for different users. The approach concludes that different people use media for different reasons, based on basic needs, social situations, and individual backgrounds.

McQuail, Blumler, and Brown proposed four important media gratifications: information, personal identity, integration and social interaction, and entertainment. Audience members can determine what they want from the media and which media best meets their needs, stating their own motives and gratifications. A model of "media-person interaction" was also proposed.
