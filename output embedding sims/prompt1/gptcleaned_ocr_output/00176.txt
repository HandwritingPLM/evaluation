Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which composes it. On the contrary, speech (parole) cover the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 1967, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structured level, langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. In contrast, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract that one must accept in its entirety to communicate. A language is a system of contractual values that resists modifications from a single individual and is thus a social institution. Speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language to express personal thought. Speech corresponds to an individual act due to its combinative activity and not a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts - the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form, while the form is the signifier, the external part of language (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis (ed.), p. 37). The correspondence between the concept/meaning to the external form is not a destined relation but an arbitrary one. It is the difference between signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that language constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences.

Meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, organized into a signifying system. The syntagmatic comprises a sentence, while the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with each other. Signs generate meaning through their relation to each other rather than to entities in an independent object world, organized through cultural conventions in a specific context (Barker, C., 2002, p. 29).
