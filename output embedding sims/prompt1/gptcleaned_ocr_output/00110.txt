Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding the public and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in public opinion is crucial. Bernays (1955) emphasizes the careful planning and engineering involved in modern public relations. He differentiates his theories from old-time propaganda by highlighting the importance of mutual understanding and benefit between businesses and the public. Public Relations (1952) further expands on the idea of public relations as a tool to combine public and persuader ideas for mutual adjustment. Through the work of various theorists like Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays, there has been a significant focus on the influence of media on public opinion. Recent research by scholars like Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw has led to a better understanding of media functions like agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming on audience perceptions.

These theories are closely tied to both direct effects and limited effects media models. Ellul, for instance, emphasized the direct influence of propaganda on mass thought, while also considering indirect effects on what people think about. This distinction has led to further research on limited media effects, as seen in the works of Iyengar and Kinder, and McCombs and Shaw. Despite being developed years ago, the theories of Lippmann and his colleagues remain relevant in helping us understand the manipulation of public opinion in society today.
