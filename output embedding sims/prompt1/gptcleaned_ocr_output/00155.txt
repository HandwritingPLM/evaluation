Like many other structuralist scholars, To Saussure, the linguistic el esa Nola Wee ree er eee by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter r ve she avec of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material it; as opposed to it, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language" Gatie 1 p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure we call langue is the social convention or value shared through a society, which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure. A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, it is essentially a collective contract that one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and a system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not to a pure creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language saide signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning, which is oe : seo oe. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, nape forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual dog in English or in Korean are the external Torpress seen Gael animal, the concept In question becomes the signified.

Under the paradigmatic, let's consider a sentence! The meaning of a sentence is established through a linear combination signs in the paradigmatic, such as girlfriend. When a sentence goes through the syntactic operations, signifiers can be substituted for by other signifiers in the paradigmatic. Saussure states that “signs do not make sense through the syn”.
