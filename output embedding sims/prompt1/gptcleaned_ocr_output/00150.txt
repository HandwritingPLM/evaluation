1. Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the concept, it can be examined chronologically, from its generation to its subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry arises out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical reproduction of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno became in effect Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin’s death, it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy. The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and was operating there. The Nazis' rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would consider departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jurgen Habermas points out, the fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the experiences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the rise of mass culture in the United States. Adorno was considered an outsider, never integrating into the British culture, and he looked forward to joining his Frankfurt associates.

As propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. Adorno and Benjamin debated mass culture, since film and radio were tools under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay “On Popular Music”, in effect, is a pessimistic reply to Benjamin’s “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction”. Adorno strongly condemned the mechanical reproduction of art. The outcome was that music could now be heard over the radio, and Adorno was emphatic that listening helps to make escape from the whole impossible. The change in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, music was inferior to the original by being reproduced on phonograph records. The result was that the original, and Adorno was emphatic that listening helped to escape from the whole in impossible.

To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction destroyed the aura of the original and was only succeeding in establishing a relationship of authority. Production was nothing f Adorno. In 1938, Max Horkheimer, who had successfully managed to continue working in the United States, worked with Adorno. In 1941, reiterating his position that the medium was bringing serious consequences, Adorno was shocked at the degree of American popular culture that had impacted the masses. The culture industry had begun.
