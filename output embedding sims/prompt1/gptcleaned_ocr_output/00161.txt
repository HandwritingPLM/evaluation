Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1931. He earned his B.A., M.A., and in 1966. For two years, he served in the U.S. during the Korean War. The book has become a standard textbook on diffusion theory in diffusion theory and its applications. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2004 as he was suffering from kidney issues. He died on October 21, 2005.

In diffusion theory, diffusion refers to "the spread of innovations communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation is an idea, practice or solution that is perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication by sharing communication through channels such as interpersonal communication. People can get information on an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed into five parts: S-M-C-R-E. Rogers mentioned, "this S-M-C-R-E model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion." Specifically, the sender can be inventors or opinion leaders, the message can be a new idea or product, channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, receivers can be members of a social system, and finally, the effects can be an individual's adoption or social change. Time is a crucial factor in diffusion theory, affecting the innovation-decision process, innovativeness, and an innovation's rate of adoption. Most innovations have an S-shaped adoption rate.

According to the evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important factors in adopting new media because new media technologies require critical mass by many users to gain efficiency. Diffusion theory also applies to practical things related to the digital divide. There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process: Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards. Rogers defined laggards as "the degree to which an individual is last in adopting new ideas than other members of his social system."

The relationships between types of adopters and innovativeness are shown in the diffusion curve. Different types of adopters and their relationships show the process of diffusion through various periods of time. Rogers mentioned that in the diffusion of innovation, there are five stages: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation.
