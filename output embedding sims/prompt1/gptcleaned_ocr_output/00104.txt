1. Return to Germany

were published by the Socialists, protesting their work but their primary work, Adorno and Horkheimer distanced themselves from their work in order not to jeopardize their work in Germany in the late 1940s. The Institute relocated to New York, opened there and Adorno became the Vice-Chancellor of Frankfurt University. In 1954, Adorno published an essay entitled "How to Look at Television" that was the result of a study conducted by George Gerbner and others. In this essay, Adorno warned that rigid institutionalization transforms every medium of undreamed-of possibilities and discussed the implications of mass culture. It is strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in classical seminars of the fifties. Adorno nonetheless attempted to express his thoughts on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal crisis in the United States, gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on "The Culture Industry Reconsidered" and in 1966, when writing the essay "Transparencies on Film," Adorno conceded that filmmaking might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry within the context of modernism.

2. One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to other writers in the Frankfurt School. Instead of culture serving ideological ends, for Marcuse, social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society. Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent. The entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to maintain social control and perpetuate the ideology. Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects of mass media could be differentiated. However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass media as separate entities from the dominant ideology. Marcuse's analysis of society allowed individuals to question how they could liberate themselves from themselves as well as from their masters. He questioned how the vicious circle could be broken. Despite the pessimistic tone of the book, Marcuse was perceived as an icon for leftist movements of the 1960s in the U.S. and Germany. Like others associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated into practice. In spite of this, Marcuse maintained a critical stance within the Frankfurt School, negotiating with publishers for the dissemination of his work.
