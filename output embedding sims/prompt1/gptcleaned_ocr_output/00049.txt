Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the Culture industry as well as its reception, the concept can be examined chronologically from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frankfurt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late 1930s Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships.

The essay translated as ‘On the Fetish Character in Music and the Regression in Listening’ is, in effect, a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin’s optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.” A problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works are heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. Unlike Benjamin, Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music and the new listening, which was made possible by photography or film. While Benjamin regarded the collapse of layers of imitations to aura as impossible, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the essential element of artistic authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school was that of criticizing mass production, which had essentially succeeded in establishing a relationship for the Institute to continue working in partnership with Columbia University.

Adorno, having lost his job due to the Nazi rise to power, eventually found a position through his work on the Princeton Radio Research Project. Adorno's skepticism towards radio as a medium for bringing culture had transformed into a realization that culture had become commercialized. Benjamin's death in 1940 marked the end of an era, as Adorno began to take on a more central role in the development of critical theory within the Frankfurt School.
