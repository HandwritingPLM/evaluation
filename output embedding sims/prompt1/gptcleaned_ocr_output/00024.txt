1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual’s background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people’s ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person interactions” to classify four important media gratifications:
1. Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release;
2. Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and 
3. Information seeking.

Another subdivided version of the audience’s motivation was based on a general theory of human needs as suggested by McGuire (1974), adding three dimensions: cognitive and affective needs, “internal” versus “external” goal orientation, and “active” versus “passive” emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation”. When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1).

Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:
1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure feelings;
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status;
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

There are specific common reasons for media use, classified under the following categories according to McQuail (1983) classification.
