Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception, the background must be examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its final implementation. The culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood movies. This development is influenced by a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno became Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin’s death, Adorno introduced a rationalized version of Benjamin's ideas into academic philosophy. The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute but lost his teaching rights in September 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party.

Adorno worked at the Princeton Radio Research Project in New York, where he became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States. Through his experiences and interactions with Benjamin, Adorno's critical approach to mass culture and the culture industry began to take shape.
