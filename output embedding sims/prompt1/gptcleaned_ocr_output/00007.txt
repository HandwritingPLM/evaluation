It is well accepted that communication takes place in various forms, including media sociology. Over the past 10 to 20 years, the two disciplines, research and media sociology, have been interlinked.

The exploration of gratifications theory in media research dates back to empirical studies such as daily newspaper (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1948). Through these studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice, support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948); rather than just offering information, the newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term "gratifications."

The Uses and Gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s until the 1970s when television grew. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among the group of scholars who focus on Uses and Gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago. For the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, he was invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting in Israel. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication. Katz joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1992 and also directed its doctoral study.

One of the pioneers of gratifications research at Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who provided important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the uses and gratification approach when he came up with the study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), a subject in which the media is used by individuals to their benefit. In a study, several aspects of gratifications research were explored by Guile Zianeaneee. They viewed the mass media as a way by which individuals connect or disconnect with others and found that people bend the media to their needs more readily than the media overpowers the user. Herzog published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which outlined a humanistic approach to looking at media use that media at best fulfills the needs of the user and that individuals select the media to fulfill their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). It also suggested that media use should be seen as cultural transmission for both society and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
