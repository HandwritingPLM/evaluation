Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding the public and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing public opinion is crucial (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself stated that the "engineering of consent" implies careful planning, distinguishing modern public relations from old-time publicity and propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Additionally, Bernays' theories offer a different view of public opinion formation compared to Lippmann, cautioning against easily manipulating the public. Rather, Bernays (1928) suggests that businesses need to study how to create mutually beneficial partnerships with the public by explaining themselves clearly (p. 66).

In "Public Relations" (1952), Bernays expands on these ideas, presenting public relations as a tool to harmonize the ideas of the public and the persuader. He emphasizes the role of public relations in helping both his clients adjust to the current situation and aiding the public in understanding it (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). While acknowledging the power of society, Bernays also recognizes the possibility of manipulating the public. He highlights the importance of public relations in helping citizens understand society, evaluate different viewpoints, exert leadership in modifying conditions, and suggest courses of action (p. 10).

Overall, the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are significant for various reasons. They have contributed to understanding how the media influences the public, leading to further research by scholars like Iyengar, Kinder, White, Lewin, McCombs, and Shaw on media functions and effects. These theories have shaped discussions around direct and limited effects media models, with theorists like Ellul supporting direct effects and others like Lippmann acknowledging the broader influence the media can have. This research has been instrumental in understanding the media's impact on public opinion and manipulation, providing valuable insights into society and communication.
