As mentioned, communication. Rogers passed away in New etd suffering from ee deface Weicaion October 21, in New Mexico in 2004. According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time to affect practices or objects among the members of a social system.

Lasswell presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E (sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E communication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion”.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness: (1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)”. Rogers defined this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other members of his social system”.

Rogers mentioned that there are five stages in the process of innovation-decisions: (1) Knowledge, (2) Persuasion, (3) Decision, (4) Implementation, and (5) Confirmation.
