1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows.

- The basic assumptions were stated in a study correlation between media and audiences:

They provide a framework for understanding the core an important part of mass media use is shaped by more or less o offer the audience

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., assumed to be goal oriented ... patterns of media use are definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience member.

2. In the mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- i.e., people are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifications research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2) needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) differential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Katz et al., 1974b, p. 20). The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of needs gratifications is still based on Katz’s first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use.

Physical needs, social integration, and individual interests contribute to different purposes of media use. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different needs may lead to different uses and gratifications from the media. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many uses of the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974). Basic needs, social situations, and the individual’s background, such as education, affect people’s ideas about what they want from media and the reasons for using different media. Audience members are aware of their needs for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Jay G. Blumler propose “the uses and gratifications approach analyses fundamental questions about the social and psychological foundations upon which audience activities, experience, interests, and motives depend to understand which media best meet their needs.”
