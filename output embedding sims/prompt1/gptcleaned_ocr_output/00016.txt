1. EARLY INFLUENCES:

Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication. The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce uncertainty.

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication. The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989):

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT) including the theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Festinger received the Distinguished Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's legacy is significant, and his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in Festinger, 1980) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of Cognitive Dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since” (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988):

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in Philosophy from the University of Graz. During his time in Europe, Heider worked with many renowned psychologists such as Wolfgang Kohler and Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial impact on his life. In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of Kansas, where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000). Heider honored Lewin's stimulating influence, which has affected much of his thinking.
