1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual’s background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people’s ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships companionship social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience’s motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth’ and “preservation.” When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire 1974).

Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information knowledge and understanding;
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure feelings
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility stability, status
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends, and
5. Tension release needs including escape and diversion.

Congruously, McQuail’s (1983) classification of the following common reasons for media use:
- Finding out about current events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society and the world
- Finding out about relevant events and conditions around the world
- Decision choice advice on practical matters OF opinion and decision making
- Seeking approval and satisfying curiosity and general interest
- Learning; self-education
- Sense of security through knowledge
- Gaining a sense of community.
