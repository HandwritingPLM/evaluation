CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public opinion (Elena eee) is a necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing audiences. Gasineasing Oe eomsenh are a ways (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase, more than anything else that distinguishes set per iniee o Re properties (Bernays 1955, p.22). These relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and are in opposition to Lippmann's views. In more, Bernays theories also represent a different view of the opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated. Bernays cautions against this, claiming that the public can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p.66), emphasizing that in attempting to influence the public, a business attitude must be made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to respond (p.66).

Bernays' ideas in Public Relations (1952) present public relations as a tool that goes beyond propaganda and focuses on the mutual benefit of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p.9). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of society but still claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, highlighting its importance to citizens in general because it helps them understand the society in which we are all a part, evaluate the viewpoint of others, exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, evaluate efforts being made by others, and suggest courses of action (p.10).

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important as they bring attention to the influence of media on the public, leading to further research on the topic. The work of Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw has developed a deeper understanding of media functions like agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and their potential effects on audiences. This paper focuses on both direct and limited effects models heavily tied to the direct effects model. Theorists like Lippmann suggest that the media could directly influence thought, providing a starting point for future research such as the work of McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of scholars like Bernays and Lippmann is very important for understanding the media and public opinion, helping us understand the society that surrounds us today.
