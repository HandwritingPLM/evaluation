Genesis of “The Culture Industry” 

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry, it can be examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through its connection to popular music, Hollywood movies, and the production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to capitalist society but also to the commodification of art and culture itself.

That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies. Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923 and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, Adorno became in effect Benjamin's only pupil. The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party.

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. Already in the late 1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture as propaganda and entertainment increased. Adorno's pessimistic view on mass culture in his essay “On the Fetish Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” contrasts Benjamin's more optimistic outlook in “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.” Adorno condemned the mechanical reproduction of music, viewing it as a destruction of authenticity, in contrast to Benjamin's idea of emancipation from hierarchical tastes.

In 1938, Max Horkheimer established a relationship for the Institute of Social Research with Columbia University, enabling the Institute to continue working in New York. Adorno obtained a position at the Princeton Radio Research Project and was shocked at the commercialization of culture in the United States.
