It is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the real past 100 years. With two disciplines, researchers see illuminated by valuable ideas as well as exploring media effects research, uses and perceptions of understanding media. As a sub-nationalist paradigm gratifications approach is suggested to be original social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). However, functional theory on communication agrees with media...

For example, a model often used in the theories discusses that “the mass media have a direct acting information into the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill 1997). A relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses and exploration of gratifications that motivate empirical Mass Communication research itself. Interested in the reasons for viewing different as daily newspapers, people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as Lazrsfeld's studies...

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s to 1990s. In 1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz’s mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one of the pioneers of gratifications research. Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the notion that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a means by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to their needs more readily than the media overpower them.

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 titled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanistic approach to looking at media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user. They also discovered that media served for both society and individuals in the functions of surveillance, correlation, and entertainment.
