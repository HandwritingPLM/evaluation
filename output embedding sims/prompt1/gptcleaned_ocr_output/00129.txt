Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22) is crucial. Bernays (1955) emphasized the importance of careful planning in modern public relations, separating it from old-time hit or miss publicity. Bernays also presents a different view of the formation of public opinion compared to Lippmann, cautioning against viewing the public as easily manipulated (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). He suggests that businesses must engage in mutual beneficial partnerships with the public, explaining themselves in understandable terms (p. 66).

In "Public Relations" (1952), Bernays introduces public relations as a tool to combine public and persuader ideas rather than simply manipulating through propaganda. He believes that public relations can help adjust the client to the contemporary situation, benefiting both parties (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). While acknowledging the power of society, Bernays believes manipulation of the public is possible, emphasizing the importance of public relations in understanding society and influencing decisions (p. 10).

The theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays hold significance for various reasons. Lippmann's work shed light on media's influence on the public, paving the way for further research on media impact by scholars like Iyengar, Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw. These theories align with both direct and limited effects media models, with Ellul favoring direct effects and Lippmann proposing media could shape what people think about. This research has been instrumental in understanding media manipulation, public opinion formation, and society as a whole. Despite being developed years ago, the theories of these scholars continue to be relevant in today's society.
