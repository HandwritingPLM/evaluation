Like many other structuralist scholars, Saussure believed that the linguistic mechanism is essentially operated by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter is parole, a set of conventions necessary for communication that are indifferent to the material of the speech itself. In contrast, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure of langue is a social convention or value shared through a society that is stable and shared. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible because the speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the social institution, and a system of values. It is the social part of the contract that one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. Language is essentially a system of contractual values that is social and is consequently a social institution, which is both institution and system of values. Speech is essentially a personal and individual act and not purely a combative activity. 

A language is therefore essentially a creation. Barthes distinguishes the language system into two parts, the form of the representation and the conceptual system, which is expressed through the form of the external part of language. For example, both the word "dog" and the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal dog is determined by the word sign (signe) to be signified (signifié) and by the signified (signifié) to be the sign-image respectively.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure separates the form from the signified. The signified is a concept in question and the form is the expression of the concept. The last two terms indicate the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts. The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not inevitable but the difference between them. Language does not designate the whole of an animal but the signifier and the signified. The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not inevitable but the difference between them.

Saussure argues that signs operate the signifying system through the correspondence of conceptual and phonic differences. According to Saussure, meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g., in synonyms) organized into a signifying system. As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of the linguistic community members. Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when they are related to each other. Signs do not make sense in relation to an independent object world, they generate meaning by reference to each other. Thus, language is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs. It is central to Saussure that red is meaningful in relation to the difference between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
