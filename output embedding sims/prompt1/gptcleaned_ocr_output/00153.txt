Diffusion refers to the process by which an innovation is communicated within a social system. An innovation is shared through communication, allowing people to gather information and perceive its usefulness. Lass (1948) presented a well-known communication model, S-M-C-R-E, which corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion.

According to Rogers (1995), there are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. These types follow a standard deviation curve and are divided based on innovativeness.

In the process of innovation-decisions, Rogers (1995) outlined five stages: knowledge, attitudes, adoption, implementation, and confirmation. These stages represent the process individuals go through when adopting a new innovation.
