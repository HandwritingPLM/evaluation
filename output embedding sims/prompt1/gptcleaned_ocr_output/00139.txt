Eloped through the realms of psychology and exploring more untilled fields in these standing media. As a sub-tradition of psychology stemmed from a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences, it is well accepted that communication theories have developed over the past 100 years. With insights illuminated by valuable ideas from these two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media effects. The uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be original and the communication society agrees with media’s effects towards people.

For example, a model often used in media theory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, latent effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses" (Watson & Hill, 105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s, which rediscovered the relationship between media and people and led to the establishment of the uses and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programs, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well as daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948). In these studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1974).

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television had grown up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication from the 1970s to 1990s. In 1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania and also directed its experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Lee RRM does canine is Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one of the pioneers of gratifications research. Important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the notion that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), a subject known as the uses and gratifications research was explored. Media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills their needs, and they have alternate choices to satisfy their need. They also discovered that media served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, cultural transmission for both society and individuals. To some extent, however, functional theory.
