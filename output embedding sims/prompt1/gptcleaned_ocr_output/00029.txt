The following theorists significantly contributed to social psychology. The influence of their work can be seen reflected in contemporary research.

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics. He had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Research Center for Group Dynamics at the University of Michigan. After Lewin's death, Festinger continued his work at Stanford University and the New School for Social Research. Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance has had a lasting impact on social psychology research.

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz. During his time in Europe, Heider worked with renowned psychologists such as Wolfgang Kohler, Max Wertheimer, and Kurt Lewin. Heider acknowledged Lewin's significant influence on his thinking.
