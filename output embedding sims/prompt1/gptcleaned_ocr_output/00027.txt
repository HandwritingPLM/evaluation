1. Early Influences
The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).
1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin’s death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and furthered Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) which attempted to show how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual’s attitude change. As in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups, relationships to occur among individuals where opinions in question have no effect on one another. Uncertainty has an element of arousal and dissonance (West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty (West & Turner, 2000).
Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to other people in their social environment to make evaluations about themselves. To evaluate the self, the individual usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to them (Samelson, 2000; Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1975) contributed to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that people seek out specific feedback regarding the appropriateness of their behavior and opinions in a particular situation” (p. 3). Festinger received the Distinguished Senior Scientist award from the American Psychological Association and the Scientist award from the Center of Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.

Festinger's theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (1980) stated that “It was in the field of cognitive dissonance, cognitive disso, and hypothesizes that Festinger's theory has not been the same since” (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)
Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Berlin where he studied the Gestalt theorists such as Wolfgang Köhler. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin's lasting influence, which continued to stimulate his thinking and contribute to Lewin’s field theory. Unfortunately, Lewin does not appear in this book, although his influence on Gestalt psychology is still strong in his theoretical framework. Heider worked with Gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka and later the University of Kansas where he remained for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).
