**Genesis of "The Culture Industry"**

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as we move through its generation, to its subsequent impact as its reception the concept can be examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions.

The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical reproduction of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies, as Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923 according to Hannah Arendt. Adorno never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, and it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of Benjamin's ideas into academic philosophy.

The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute, but he lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party. This event also affected his philosophical thought and ultimately forced his departure from Germany. 

The Nazis rise to power also influenced the development of critical theory, with Adorno joining his colleagues in Frankfurt. Adorno's main concern was with the production of mass culture and how it affected society. He continued to work on this issue, even spending time at the Princeton Radio Research Project in the United States, where he saw firsthand the commercialization of culture.
