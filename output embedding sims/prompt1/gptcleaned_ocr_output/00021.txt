Barthes, like many other structuralist scholars, was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics.

Saussure believed that the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels: the systematic system and the variation by speaking actors. The former is called "langue" and the latter "parole." Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signal that composes it; on the other hand, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1967, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structural level, langue, is the social convention or value shared throughout a society that is stabilized and standardized. In contrast, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible because speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language; essentially a collective contract that one must accept in its entirety to communicate. Because a language is a system of contractual values, it resists modifications from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language to express his personal thoughts. Because speech is essentially a combinative activity, it corresponds to an individual act and not a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. Saussure argues that "meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g., a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system" (Barker, 2002, p. 29).

In a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when they are related to each other. "Meaning is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs" (Barker, C., 2002, p. 29).

"It is central to Saussure's argument that red is meaningful in relation to the difference between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence that generates meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
