Commercialization of culture in Europe. Further, the prevalence in the United States had gone far beyond any prevalence of advertising in Europe. The closest thing Adorno had seen in Europe was fascist propaganda (JÃ¤ger, 2007) which was something he had seen in the advertising industry in the United States (Rodger, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later involved in the culture industry in the United States through the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture.

Division of consensus distinguishes the industry by stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002).

Adorno's dissatisfaction with the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University eventually motivated him to further develop the idea of the culture industry. Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industry are all important to an understanding of his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business and this, in turn, became an ideology to legitimize the trash intentionally produced (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism, in which mass production was implemented in centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 142). Examples of this were the Hollywood production system, movies associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project, and the CBS radio network.
