1. Return to Germany

In 1949, the works of Horkheimer and Adorno were published without their permission, causing them to leave. Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing themselves. In the late 1940s, the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and in 1951 a new building opened in its new premises. Horkheimer returned to the University of Frankfurt. In 1954, Adorno published an essay that looked at Television, the result of collaboration with the Hacker Foundation. Adorno criticized the rigid institutionalization of modern mass culture which turned it into a medium of undreamed potential. This was one of the few times in the 1950s that someone discussed the implications of mass culture. Despite being one of the leading cultural theorists of his time, Adorno did not actively participate in cultural events. However, he did attempt to reshape his thoughts on the culture industry. For instance, in 1959 he wrote about a universal pseudo-culture in the United States and later gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, in his essay Transparencies on Film, Adorno acknowledged that filmmaking could be a valid cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the realm of modernism.

2. One-Dimensional Man and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse provided a systematic analysis of late capitalist society that differed from other writers in the Frankfurt School. He believed that social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society integrated individuals into mass society. The system of repressive affluence created by capitalist production kept society content and subdued. Society was structured around an ideology focused on maintaining social control and perpetuating the controlling ideology. Marcuse, like Adorno, questioned the differentiation between the informative and entertaining aspects of mass media and their manipulation and indoctrination. However, Marcuse did not separate culture or mass media from the dominant ideology in the same way as Adorno. He pondered how individuals could liberate themselves from the system of social control and replicate it on a larger scale. Despite his pessimistic tone, Marcuse did not see himself as an activist but rather a philosopher, leading to criticisms from both the U.S. and Germany. Ultimately, he was perceived as an inspiration for oppositional movements, although he remained cautious about the role of theory in instigating change.
