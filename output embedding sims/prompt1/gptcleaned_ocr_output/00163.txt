Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception, the concept can be examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights regarding the production of culture, and is ultimately generated in relation not only to popular music but also movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Adorno never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, he became in effect Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin’s death, “it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began operating there. The Nazis' rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frankfurt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late 1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture.

While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project, Adorno became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.
