Like many scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the first being langue and the second being speech. Langue consists of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the individual. In contrast, speech (parole) covers the purely individual expression. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, langue, represents social conventions or values shared within a society that are standardized and stabilized. Parole, on the other hand, is flexible because it involves the individual level of expression. However, it remains relatively flexible because individual speech cannot be entirely free from the shared conventions of the structure.

Barthes divides the language system into two parts, focusing on the systematic level as Saussure did. For example, the word “dog” in English or in Korean has the same concept, but different signifiers. The concept becomes the signified and the word represents the signifier. Saussure argues that language does not reflect a pre-existing reality of independent objects, but constructs its meaning through the selection and combination of signs within a system. This process is organized into a signifying system that operates through selection and combination along two axes, syntagmatic and paradigmatic. The relation between signs creates meaning through the difference established within the sequence that generates a coherent structure.
