The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of mass media use is shaped by more or less patterns of media use. In the Mass Communication process, much initiative in media choice lies with the audience member, theorizing about any form of straight-line effect linking need gratification. This places a strong limitation on the impact of media content on attitudes and needs satisfaction. The needs served by Mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption certainly varies.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves. People are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms.

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people to the media, they did not address the connections between these gratifications. They suggested that uses and gratifications research concern with the social and psychological origins of needs which generate expectations of the mass media or other sources which lead to differential exposure, resulting in need gratification and other consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones. The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and gratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use.

The Uses and Gratifications approach emphasizes motives and self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users. Factors such as the individual's background, experience, interests, and education affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important media gratifications.
