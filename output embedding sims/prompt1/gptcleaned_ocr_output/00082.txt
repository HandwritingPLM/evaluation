The level of structure therefore interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level embodies social convention or values shared through a society, which is stable and standardized. In contrast, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, the fact that speech by an individual cannot be separate from the language.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language; it is essentially a collective contract that one must accept in its entirety to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists modifications from a single individual and is thus a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the language code to express personal thoughts. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not pure creation.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form, called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word "dog" in English or Korean are external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. Saussure proposes the use of the terms signified and signifier to indicate the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts. The correspondence between concept/meaning and external form is arbitrary, not inevitable.

Language does not reflect a pre-existing external reality but constructs meaning from within itself through conceptual and phonic differences. Meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along the syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes. A grammatical set of signs or syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic comprises a set of signs that can be replaced within a sentence. Signs generate meaning by reference to each other and are understood as a code that is meaningful in relation to the differences between signs.
