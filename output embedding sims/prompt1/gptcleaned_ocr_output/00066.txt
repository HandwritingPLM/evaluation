According to Rogers (1996), diffusion, communicated through certain channels over time, refers to the process by which an innovation, an idea, or practice among the members of a social system is communicated. The diffusion involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels.

Rogers (1948) presented a model of an innovation that assumes parts such as sender, message, channels, receiver, and effect. The model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion.
