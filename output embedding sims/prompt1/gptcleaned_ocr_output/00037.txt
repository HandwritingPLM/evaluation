In the later part of the decade, Oloff and Berger became popular. Bees (CGS) ICE oe anes adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and ea apoeas aarnenae Cae rays helped shape the interpersonal communication research. Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically investigate po intenances and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized Motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975), in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has opment the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on the research of uncertainty reduction. It is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the "number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say". Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can cause stress and anxiety which can lead to low levels of communicator competence. Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or may be too anxious on their interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty caused by nonverbal behavior, increased levels of gaia, and unpredictability with the goal that this will lead to the actions individuals are expected to He. When high uncertainty exists it's often Pe oe air seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty each this in vulnerability can inhibit a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: "Too much certainty and predictability can deaden a relationship."
