Science communication appeals to many readers.

Like many other social scientists, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. The system operates on two levels: one systematic and the other variation. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of communication, while parole is the social convention shared within a society.

On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression shared through a society. A language is a social institution and a system of values. It is essentially a collective contract that one must accept in its entirety to communicate. Speech, on the other hand, is an individual act of selection and actualization. Speech corresponds to an individual act rather than a pure creation.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form, while the signifier is the external part of language. The correspondence between concept and form is arbitrary, constructed through the difference between signs in the signifying system.

Saussure argues that language constructs meaning from within itself through a combination of signs. The selection of signs is regulated by the consensus of linguistic communities. The syntagmatic and paradigmatic structures organize signs into a coherent system, allowing for a range of possible meanings.

In conclusion, Saussure's approach emphasizes the importance of structural conventions in generating meaning within a particular context.
