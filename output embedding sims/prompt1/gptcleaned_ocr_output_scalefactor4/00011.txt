Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the public has been greatly influenced by the role of media, public opinion, and propaganda in influencing society. From Corrie, Bernays (1955) himself emphasized the significance of engineering consent by careful planning in modern public relations rather than old-time methods. Unlike Lippmann's view of the public as a passive mass, Bernays argues that the public needs to be engaged and understood on mutual terms to be influenced effectively.

Bernays further discusses these concepts in Public Relations (1952), presenting public relations as a tool for combining public ideas with persuaders' objectives. This approach aims at helping clients adapt to contemporary situations or guiding the public through change. While Bernays acknowledges the potential for manipulation, he also stresses the importance of public relations in fostering public understanding, evaluating diverse viewpoints, leading change, and influencing action.

The theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are essential for several reasons. Lippmann's focus on media influence, coupled with recent research by Iyengar, Kinder, White, Berelson, and McCombs and Shaw, has broadened our understanding of media effects on audiences. By exploring agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, these theories provide valuable insights into media's impact on public perception.

These theories have shaped contemporary media models and offer contrasting perspectives on media effects. While Ellul emphasizes direct influence, Lippmann and others explore limited effects, prompting debates on media's true role in shaping public opinion. Understanding these theories is crucial in navigating the complexities of media influence and public perception in today's society.
