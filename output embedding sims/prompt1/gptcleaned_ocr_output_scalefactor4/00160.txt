1 EARLY INFLUENCES

Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication. The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce uncertainty.

1 Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication. The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but later followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of uncertainty reduction theory (URT). Festinger is best known for his cognitive dissonance theory, which posits how inconsistencies in beliefs might affect an individual's relationships with others: a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in conflict, versus a consonant relationship, in which cognitions concerning the topic in question have no effect. Cognitive uncertainty has an element of ambiguity where individuals seek to predict, monitor, and gain feedback from others. Festinger usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self, which can result in conformity pressures (Tremblay & Fenson, 2011). Berger extends Festinger's social comparison theory by stating that "Festinger has suggested that persons search for others who are proximate to themselves when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding their behavior and/or opinions." Festinger received the Distinguished Scientist Award of the American Psychological Association and the Kurt Lewin Memorial Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social psychology. Festinger (2008) stated, "It will be interesting to see how cognitive dissonance theory develops in the future."

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in psychology in Europe. Heider worked with many peers, one of them being Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin's stimulating influence, which remained strong even after Lewin's death. In 1924, Heider moved to the United States and settled in Kansas, where he worked for the remainder of his career. During his time at the University of Kansas, Heider conducted research that significantly departed from his work. Heider later moved to Purdue University and later the University of California at Santa Barbara.
