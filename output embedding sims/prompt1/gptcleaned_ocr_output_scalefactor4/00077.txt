Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

The uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in communication research. The core question is why people use media and what they use them for. This approach suggests that audiences actively choose and use media based on their needs, rather than passively receiving information. It focuses on "what people do with media" rather than "what media do to people." The approach also considers how media compete with other information sources to satisfy audience needs. As traditional and new media offer a wide range of platforms and content, this approach is valuable in understanding audience preferences.

The approach emphasizes audience choice, reasons for using certain media, and the gratifications obtained based on individual needs. It provides a framework for understanding how audiences selectively seek information or content to fulfill their interests. Communication theories have developed over the past century, merging psychology and sociology to better understand media.
