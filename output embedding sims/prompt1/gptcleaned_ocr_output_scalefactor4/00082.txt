To Pepe! Structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics by speaking of two levels, the systematic system and the variation colors. The former is called langue and the latter is a set of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material. Opposed to it, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language, as per Barthes.

Saussure's linguistic system exists within the social framework of social conventions and shared values through society. While language is institution and system, speech is an individual act of selection and actualization, expressing personal thought.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes two parts of the language system, the signified, and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through form, known as the signifier. The relation between concept and form is arbitrary, not destined.

Language constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonetic differences, produced by the selection and combination of signs along the syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes. Signs do not make sense by reference to external entities, but through relations between signs.

Meaning is understood as a social convention, meaningful in relation to the difference of their usage within a particular context.
