1. RETURN TO GER

There were publications without their permission in 1 Ã©: we are from here acre fever as Horkheimer and Adorno protested, leading to the relocation of the Institute to Frankfurt since their return to Germany. In 1954, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt, Im, was entitled "How to Look at Television." Adorno published an essay on television that was the product of a study involving George Gerbner and others, showing how the commercialization transforms mass culture into a medium of undreamed significance. Adorno discussed the implications of commercialization and mass culture, highlighting that the leading theorists of his day did not take part in the joyce. Adorno was a vocal critic of the culture industry and advocated reconsidering the universal paradigm of culture industry. When writing in Germany in 1963, Adorno conceded that filmmaking might be an icon within the context of the culture industry. 

2. One-Dimensional Man and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse provided an analysis of late capitalist society in contrast to other writers in the Frankfurt School. Instead of culture serving ideological ends for social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society, capitalism produced tremendous wealth that formed a system of repression and quiescence. Marcuse wondered whether individuals could be differentiated from their manipulations in the culture industry, as it is difficult to distinguish culture from mass manipulation. Despite these challenges, Marcuse's analysis allowed for oppositional forces to develop an oppositional stance against the manipulation of culture. Adorno and Marcuse both pondered on the possibility of developing an alternative perspective that could break from the dominance of financial and commercial control over society. They sought to develop an oppositional stance against manipulation through individual awareness and critical engagement with the ideology of the culture industry.
