The Culture Industry: Enlightenment and Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture and high art couldn't be more different. They were mere opposites, and the former became a means to degrade the latter. This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism, and it was meant to highlight the manufacturing process in the cultural world, centered around Ford's techniques of mass production. Examples of this art by Adorno were the Hollywood productions and the radio network associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies and music were formulaic, and the form often replaced the content. Mechanical reproduction ensured no real change to the system, maintaining the status quo. Essentially, any innovation was stifled, and Adorno cited Orson Welles as an example of someone who was allowed to challenge the norm but not transcend it. The industry was a form of social control, restricting freedom to only superficial choices.
