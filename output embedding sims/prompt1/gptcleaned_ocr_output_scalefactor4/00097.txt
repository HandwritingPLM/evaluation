Her structuralist scholars, B. Barbier, Barthes, and Saussure, the linguistic mechanisms.

Structural linguistics operates on two levels: langue and parole. Langue is the systematic structure of language, indifferent to the material of the signal. Speech (parole) covers the individual part of language.

Language is a social institution and a system of values, essentially a collective contract for communication. It is a system of contractual agreements that resist modifications from a single individual.

Saussure distinguishes the signified (concept or meaning) and the signifier. The signifier is the external form of language, such as words in English or Korean. The correspondence between the concept and the external form is a conventional relation.

Language does not reflect an external reality but creates meaning through a series of conceptual and perceptual differences. Meaning is produced through a process of selecting and combining signs.

The syntagmatic organizes signs linearly, while the paradigmatic involves a selection of signs regulated by linguistic consensus. Signs generate meaning by reference to each other rather than to external entities.

These signs are organized into a systemic structure, such as colors, for specific usage within a cultural context.
