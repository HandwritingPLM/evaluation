| NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows.

They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of mass media use is seen to be goal-oriented. Patterns of media use are shaped by more or less definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience member.

In the mass communication process, the initiative in linking need gratification and media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and behavior.

The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by mass communication contribute just a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption certainly varies.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves. People are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms.

In addition, Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous research on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people to the media, they did not address the connections between these gratifications. They suggested that uses and gratifications research concerns the social and psychological origins of needs which generate expectations of the mass media or other sources, leading to differential exposure or engaging in other activities, resulting in need gratification and other consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones. The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation for building the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current state of uses and gratifications is still based on Katz's initial analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in this electronic information age when people have more options for media use.

Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same content for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for media use as there are media users. Factors such as needs, socialization, and the individual's background, such as experiences, education, affect people's decisions about what they want from media and which media are appealing. Audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1973) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: why?
