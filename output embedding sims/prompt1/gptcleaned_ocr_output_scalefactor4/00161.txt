Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1951. He earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, he worked on communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and its applications in various fields.

Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2004 and passed away from kidney disease on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1995), diffusion refers to â€œthe process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation is a practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels.

Communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass communication are where people can get information about an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful.

Rogers (1995) mentioned that "there is a close correspondence between the elements of the S-M-C-R communication model and the elements of diffusion. Specifically, sender can be innovators or opinion leaders, message can be a new idea or product, channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, receivers can be members of a social system, and finally, the effects can be individual's adoption or social change.

In diffusion theory, the variable of "Time" is very important. Rogers (1995) states that time is involved in diffusion in the innovation-decision process; in innovativeness, and in innovation's rate of adoption. Different research has shown variation in adoption behavior and audience segmentation, such as the influence of media, interpersonal influences, and personal opinions. Variables like the rate of analysis and the degree of innovation are required by the participants.

In the diffusion process, there are five different types of adopters according to innovation. These are: (1) Innovators, (2) Early Adopters, (3) Early Majority, (4) Late Majority, and (5) Laggards.

Rogers (1995) points out that some individuals or groups are more effective in adapting new ideas than others. Relationships between people also play a crucial role in the diffusion process.

Overall, Rogers' diffusion theory can be applied to various fields and situations.
