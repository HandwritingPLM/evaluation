1. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists
L1) Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself.

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both quantitative and qualitative analysis of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda, and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience. Lasswell is credited with creating the mass communication procedure of content analysis. Generally, content analysis can be defined as “the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications in order to measure certain variables”. In an essay entitled “Functions of Communication,” Lasswell explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell aims to achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from canal to content and from contingent to audience”.

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell’s early definition of communication which measured, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects”. Content analysis was essentially the sense what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them, and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is all that information that is affecting their decisions within the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of showing the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

2. Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda, Edward Bernays was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays defines propaganda as "a conscious, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a public to an enterprise, idea, or group". Contrary to other propaganda theories, Bernays recognizes that propaganda can be beneficial or harm the public. It can help individuals decide what to think about or alter the opinions of individuals, but does this actually be beneficial to society's functioning as a whole. Bernays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of... Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society”.

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and the work shaping is a necessary part of society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of public relations. “Public Relations is the attempt, by information, persuasion, and adjustment, to engineer public support for an action. He refers to public relations as "the engineering of consent" which is the framework for understanding the design and directing of a public relations campaign. Bernays claims that the key to a successful campaign is the adjustment of the campaign to the attitudes of various interest groups, to express an idea, and finally, utilizing persuasion or influence the public opinion in the intended direction.

Bernays' theories represent a step forward for mass communication as they are not just typical prescriptions of "hic propaganda," and move more towards a deeper understanding of how propaganda can influence public opinion.
