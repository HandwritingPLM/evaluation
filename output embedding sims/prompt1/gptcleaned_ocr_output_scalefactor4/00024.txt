Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes how different people have different needs when it comes to media consumption. Blumler and Katz (1974) argue that people use media for various purposes, and individuals may have unique needs when it comes to using media.

Basic needs for media use can vary depending on the individual and the situation, such as for entertainment, information, social interaction, or education. Blumler and Katz (1974) classify four important media functions: surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission.
