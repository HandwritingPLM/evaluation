Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels: the synchronic system of the structure and the diachronic system of the history. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of elements necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which composes it, as opposed to parole, speech (namely) that covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 1987, p. 13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, langue, is the social convention of values shared through society which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. As the social part of language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language to express his personal thoughts. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not to pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure categorizes the language system into two parts: signified and signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through its form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, the word "dog" in English or in Korean are the material form expressing the actual animal. The concept in question, animal, becomes the signified. In order to retain the word "sign," it is necessary to distinguish between signified (concept) and signifier (sound-image). The former has the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are a part.

Saussure argues that language serves to construct meaning from the perceptual and external reality of independent objects. It achieves this through a process of selection and association of signs. The paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations between signs create a systematic and grammatical set of signs which form a field of possible sign combinations that can comprise a sentence. Despite various possibilities in meaning, the selection between the syntagmatic and paradigmatic is always guided by cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
