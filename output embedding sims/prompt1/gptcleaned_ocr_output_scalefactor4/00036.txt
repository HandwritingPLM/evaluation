Newell accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology over the past 10 years. With their valuable data as well as exploring more untied fields in these disciplines, researchers elicit a series of different conceptions of media. As a sub-traction of media effects research, the Uses and Gratifications approach is believed to have originally stemmed from a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory does not agree with media's effects on individual people. For example, a model observed in the Hypodermic Springs theory discusses that mass media have a direct, immediate, and influential effect upon audiences by injecting information into the consciousness of the masses (Watson Hill DDS? p 105). Functional theory influenced studies of communication from the 1960s to the 1970s, after which a rediscovery of the relationship between media and people occurred and led to the establishment of new research approaches.

The exploration of gratifications showed that most people are attracted to particular media content based on specific interests and needs, empirical mass communication research. Reflect (Metzal, 1993) dating back to the 1960s saw researchers become interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programs, such as soap operas and news on 26 daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld ADS Stanton, 1940; Herzog, 1966; Warner & Beery, 1972; etc.). In these studies, researchers discovered a variety of functions carried out by media content or by the medium itself (Munyef al, 1974b). For instance, consumers of soap operas were found to have preferences for emotional relaxation (Herzog & Warren, 1966), while news readers were also discovered to be important for giving readers a sense of credibility through topics of conversation and a structure to their daily routine (Reason, 1981). Due to this diverse direction of engagement in media selection, researchers applied the term "prodricas" here.

Uses and gratifications approach became revived beginning in the late 1940s but declined when Television Focus Group was discovered during that era. Among the group of scholars who focused on the Uses and Gratifications approach, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known and greatly contributed to establishing the discipline of their approach.

Elihu Katz started out as win academic extra and communications researcher. He earned his background in sociology in the 1950s from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1959. During the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communications at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1980s, aided by the government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of satellite broadcasting. The experience led to subsequent academic work examining broadcasting and television behaviors, cultures, and communication strategies. By 2002, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School and then a variety of Parisian universities, or even the International Scholars Program for media researchers. Their creative partnerships, work projects support substantial growth that underscores the impact of practice-based or functional theory. Later, Katz and others continued with celebrating a core "intellectual," often paired with earlier ideas of the nature of communications or media practices.

Along with colleague Paul Lazarsfeld, Katz established a rigorous quantitative research approach for analyzing and bridged the gaps between individual consumers of broadcast media. They developed substantial theoretical frameworks that worked to shape the discourse surrounding media effects on audiences. They suggested that media content could sway individuals in certain ways, with correlations, entertainment, engagement, and intellectual refreshment being key elements.
