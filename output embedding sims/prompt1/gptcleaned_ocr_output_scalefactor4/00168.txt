Needs and Gratifications

The Uses and Gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived gratifications of users. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same media content for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs of individuals. There is not only one way that people consume media as many purposes exist as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

The social situation and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, influence people's ideas about what they seek from media and which media best satisfy their needs. Audiences are aware of and can express their motivations and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to identify four significant media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escaping from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social support; (3) Personal identity: self-referent; exploring reality; reinforcing values; and (4) Surveillance (seeking information).

A more detailed understanding of the audience's motivations was suggested by McGuire (1974) based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between cognitive and affective needs and added dimensions of "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotional stability of "growth" and "preservation." This results in 16 different types of motivations applicable to media use (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1979) identified 35 needs derived from the social and psychological functions of mass media and categorized them into five groups:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, and feelings;
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, and status;
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Similarly, Rutledge (1985) categorized common reasons for media use as:

- Finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world;
- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinions and decision choices;
- Satisfying curiosity and personal interests;
- Learning and self-education; and
- Gaining a sense of security through knowledge.
