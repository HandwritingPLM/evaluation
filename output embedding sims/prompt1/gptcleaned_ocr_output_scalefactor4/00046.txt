Early Influences

Therefore, uncertain concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.
The following is how uncertainty can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce uncertainty.

1 Early Influences
The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty pa
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1912).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt eee I ei
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a
substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development. He took the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lew foreshadowed COT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). COT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2020). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of discomfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory posits that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to themselves. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2016). Berger and Calabrese related social comparison to CRT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others
who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 101). Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the American Psychological and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social. Festinger’s legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in
Festinger, 2000) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has never been the same since” (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Vienna in
Austria. Heider worked with many renowned psychologists such as Adler
and Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial
influence in psychology due to Lewin's stimulating influence, which has affected much
still strong even in this book, although it does not derive directly from
their life experience.

ial impact on his life: “I want
much of my thinking and which is

‘: om Whit work” (Heider, 1958, p.
vii). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of
Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).
