The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception 
For Adorno, popular culture on flro and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. #5). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in the cultural sphere insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl
1995, p. 142). Examples of this nat specified by Adorno were the Hollywood production system, the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project Mowies and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplanted the work (Horkheiner and Adorno, 2002, p. FS). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be early real change ba page aie and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, BP 106-7).
