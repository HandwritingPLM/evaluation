Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until
November 1941. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that
included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Doblin, and
Bertolt Brecht, several of whom found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno
was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood
movies must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture since the Hollywood system
inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditionsAdorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 16). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of this specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplanted the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. 84). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles
as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 16). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of coercion
ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, p. 26).
