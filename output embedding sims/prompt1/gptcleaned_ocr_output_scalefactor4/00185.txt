Annd that when the term ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but disruptions continued. There was one tasteless demonstration in which three females bared their breasts a few months later.

4 Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real engagement with the culture industry questioning outside of a German context. In the current reading of the text, notable are generalizations such as "the commodified and fetishizes character of all cultural goods." Cook criticized that Adorno erred in only discussing the processes of cultural production and failed to examine the culture industry as business sectors, including marketing and advertising. Despite the appearance of the head of the Institute for Social Research, Max Horkheimer, in public lectures supporting Adorno's work, Adorno increasingly emphasized the dependence on other Marxist theorists and theorists from other disciplines. Jager summed it up as an all-pervasive reification.

Eagleton stated that "the cloudy of the signs of social Reality distinguishes in the qfl of an all-pervasive reification." Eagleton conceded that "the commodification of human values and relations has become a universal phenomenon, even among oppressed members of society who may participate in some part of the consumer game." Fredric Jameson noted that Adorno's conception of a culture industry was theoretically limited to one which "cannot cope with new trends in culture." While the work on the culture industry can be seen as a useful means of making alliances between sociology and art, the divisive nature of post-war history and criticism still weakens it.

For Terry Eagleton, the critical theory of the Frankfurt School was essential in revealing that "Capitalism is a system of reproduction" with limitations on culture and the possibilities of resistance. Thus, for a time, Adorno's legacy may have seemed historical, but it is worth studying and developing in order to reveal the cultural possibilities of today.

Some points of Adorno can be co-opted into works for a timely theoretical framework. Overall, Eagleton stated that he had always been skeptical about the rationality of the culture industry since his first engagement with its discourse.
