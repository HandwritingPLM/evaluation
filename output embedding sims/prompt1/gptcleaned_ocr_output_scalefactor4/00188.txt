It is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology over the past 100 years. With framed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untried fields in these two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding, media as a sub-division of media effects research, was viewed gratifications approach initially stemmed from a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumer & Katz, 1978). To better elucidate, some theories on communication agree with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the theory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses” (Walton & Mills 1976, p. 105). Functional theory influenced that the 1980s. After that, a hiht

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is as old as empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1994). Dating back to the 1980s, researchers became interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programs, such as Soap Operas and quizzes, as well as daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1989; Kernog, 1944; Blumer & Henry, 1943, etc.). In their studies, researchers discovered a list of themes generated either by some specific content or by the medium itself (Ibid, 1974). For instance, radio soap operas were found to supply the listener with advice, gossip, or occasions for emotional release (Kernog, 1944; Blumer & Henry, 1948); meanwhile, the newspaper was also discovered to be important to provide readers a sense of security, shared topics for conversation, and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1950). For these diverse dimensions of usage satisfaction, psychologist Neulog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s. This was when Gelenesior began to rise. Some basic understandings of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among the group of scholars who focused on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is greatly well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served as both a sociologist and a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1962. During the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communications at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work on broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication from the 1970s onwards (UPEMN, 50). In 1980, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its experimental Scholar program for post-doctoral research.

Another key contributor is Paul Lazarsfeld, who was one of the pioneers of gratifications research. Their cooperative work produced important extensions that connect the concept of gratifications with the functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratifications approach when he came up with the notion that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1972), a subject which lies at the core of gratifications research was explored. They reviewed the ways by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 titled The Uses of Mass Communications. They took a more humanistic approach by looking at media as a medium for users. They suggested that media were a toolkit and users chose the medium that best fulfilled their needs, with alternate choices to satisfy that need (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission for both society and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
