CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be made amicable and mutually beneficial.

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts being made by others and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion.

Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a few reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that the public is able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues led to a deeper understanding of the public, showing through recent research that is meant to better understand the influence of the media on public attitudes. Through the work of Mynegar and Kinder, White, Lippmann, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of how various media functioned and their influences on the public has been developed. The theories presented in this paper help to establish a framework for understanding the role of media in shaping public opinion and how different theorists contribute to this understanding.
