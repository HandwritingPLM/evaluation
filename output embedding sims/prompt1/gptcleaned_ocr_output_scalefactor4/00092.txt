1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewis, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Paterson. Berger (2005) states: “These early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda over the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is mediated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on the theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is central to our understanding of interpersonal processes. 

DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1947) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of LET. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger expanded the concept of uncertainty in interpersonal communication by defining one way in which each interactants' level of uncertainty lies in a situation, the smaller the chance also predicting present and past behaviors but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity people process when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the number of alternative things that the sender and receiver could do or more the range of alternative things that either party might behave" (pp. 100). The greater the more that behavior. Uncertainty plays a significant role in maintaining relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development because it puts stress and anxiety on partners, decreasing intimacy and trust. Heath et al. (2000) point out that when uncertainly is reduced, so is increased verbal and nonverbal behavior. Decreased levels of uncertainty predictability with the greater ability to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty is present, it is difficult to reach this level. Although individuals seek to reduce their anxiety, high levels of uncertainty patency constrain initial interactions and the ability to develop relationships. West and Turner (20XX) define uncertainty reduction as "the processes by which people gather information about others to reduce uncertainty about what those others might behave" (pp. 100). The greater the increase verbal and nonverbal behavior, decreased levels of intimacy and trust, increased predictability with the greater ability to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty is present, it is difficult to reach this level. Although individuals seek to reduce their uncertainty, high levels of uncertainty can present challenges in reaching and maintaining relationships. Heath et al. (2000) state: “To reduce uncertainty is to reduce insecurity in a relation of Uncertainty, high levels of uncertainty have been recurrently connected with relational turmoil and have also been linked to poor communication cooperation and a weak relationship”
