The book "Diffusion of Innovations," has become the standard text on Communication projects in Korea. The theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, and sociology has been successful. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico after suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2008. Communication through certain channels is crucial. Diffusion refers to the process by which an innovation spreads over time, involving individuals or units of adoption. By sharing through mass media and using communication channels, people can get information easily. This is an important factor in an individual's adoption or social change. There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process: Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards. Rogers defined this term as "the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas compared to other members of his social system." Figure 1 shows the relationships of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Innovations follow an S-shaped curve. However, different types of adoption can be faster than others. Figure 2 shows the different stages of innovations/decisions.
