Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the influence of their examination of uncertainty in communication.

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. In the research of group dynamics, initially at the University of Rochester, Festinger's work can be seen at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After his death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further progressed Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the theory of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another (West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and discomfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social comparison can result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004).

Berger and Calabrese (1973) related Festinger's theories to URT by stating that persons seek out similar others who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation.

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz. During his time in Europe, Heider worked with many renowned psychologists such as Wolfgang Kohler and Max Wertheimer. Heider recognized Lewin's substantial impact on his life: “I want to pay tribute to Kurt Lewin, whose stimulating influence has affected much of my professional life” (Heider, 1958, p. 3). Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later at the University of Kansas, where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).
