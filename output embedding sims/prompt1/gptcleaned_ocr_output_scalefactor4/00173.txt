GENESIS OF “THE CULTURE INDUSTRY"

Genesis of “The Culture Industry"

The concept can be seen in its creation, as well as its reception through its generation and subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into mechanical reproduction, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music but also to Hollywood movies. This development is influenced by historical contingencies.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never achieved a degree to teach at a university, Adorno became Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin's death, Adorno rationalized and introduced his ideas into academic philosophy. This relationship with Benjamin impacted the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Adorno began teaching at the Institute in Frankfurt. However, he lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party to power. The Nazis' rise also affected Adorno's philosophical thought.

Adorno worked on a manuscript on Husserl while at Oxford from 1934 to 1938. He felt like an outsider and hoped to join his colleagues at the Frankfurt School who had moved to the United States. Adorno, along with Benjamin, debated mass culture as propaganda and entertainment increased. Adorno was pessimistic about mass culture and criticized the mechanical reproduction of music as a means of escape from the infantile milieu.

In 1938, Max Horkheimer secured a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, where Adorno questioned the claim that radio was bringing serious music to the masses. Adorno's work at the project showed him how culture had become commercialized in the United States.
