J) EARLY INFLUENCES

Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication. The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of this influence:

1. Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the new branch of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1941 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger's research was based on his mentor Lewin and further developed several theories that were highly regarded.

He proposed theories such as cognitive dissonance, in which individuals seek to reduce inconsistencies in their beliefs and actions, and social comparison theory, which suggests that people compare themselves to others in order to evaluate their own abilities and opinions. This can result in conformity pressures (Trentole and Jensen, 2004). Heider and Kelley further expanded on these ideas by stating that "Festinger has suggested that people can survive the high life training that others impose on them by adopting the appropriate behaviors."

1.2) Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from a university in Europe. Heider worked closely with many notable psychologists and recognized Kurt Lewin as a substantial influence. Heider, like Festinger, acknowledged Lewin's stimulating influence, although his work did not directly come from Lewin's.

Upon his arrival in the United States, Heider worked at Smith College and later at the University of Kansas where he spent the remainder of his career (Ash, 2000). Heider's theoretical influence can still be recognized in communication studies. Festinger, (1940) once said, "It was in that era that Leon Festinger introduced the concept of cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, some of psychology and behavioral science have never been the same since."
