Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry, it must be examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, and its subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood movies. That this idea grew out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Adorno never received a degree that would allow him to teach, but became in effect Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin's death, Adorno tried to introduce a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy. The relations with Benjamin had a significant impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute, but lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party. While Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Switzerland, the Nazis' rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jurgen Habermas later noted, the departure from Germany due to the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical experiences influencing the development of critical theory.

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked as an outsider. His philosophical thought was impacted by the rise of propaganda and entertainment during the 1930s, which led to debates with Benjamin about mass culture. Adorno's pessimistic view on the mechanical reproduction of music contrasted with Benjamin's more optimistic view on art in the age of mechanical reproduction. Adorno believed that mass production was a destruction of authenticity, in contrast to Benjamin's view of emancipation from hierarchical tastes. Adorno's general attitude reflected that of the Frankfurt School.

In 1938, Max Horkheimer established a relationship with Columbia University for the Institute of Social Research, enabling the Institute to continue working in New York. Adorno obtained a position at the Princeton Radio Research Project, where he became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States. While working with the Radio Research Project, Adorno questioned the impact of mass culture and the claims around it.
