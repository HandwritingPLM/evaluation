1. CRITICAL RESPONSE TO "THE CULTURE INDUSTRY"

He complained to the dean about the radical students in teaching impossible. In the winter term of 1968-69, students at the University at Frankfurt, including his classes, were making Bate de ce occupied a number of buildings at Institute of Social Research. After the strike, sealed he continued to be disrupted, including “taste emotion" in which three females bared their breasts. Adama died a few months later (Jager, 2004, p. 201-08).

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the Culture Industry outside of a German context. In the years since, there have been numerous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about “the commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, believing that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant ideology among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the system as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno's idea of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during his time. While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial societies between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 146-48). Thus, for some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry appears to be merely historical, if they in fact concede that it had any relevance in contemporary practice.

As noted in the example of Orson Welles, the idea of the culture industry works for its own ends. Critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in relation to ideology, and the role of mass communication. Adorno made sweeping generalizations that he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated. In some cases, the idea of a culture industry is obsolete. For example, motion pictures are still made by large companies based on formulaic plots, as broadcast stations operate. As a broadcast system is very much in comparison to the Internet, that situation is that the commercial companies continue to maintain an influence that anyone can create a website).

In conclusion, for example, one seldom sees (on the Internet continue to maintain an influence that the commercial companies operating on MSNBC or Yahoo seek to appease the prerogatives of corporate America. A reexamination of the idea of dominant ideologies is necessary in order to theorize on the cultural industry. Mass communication media propagate dominant ideologies.
