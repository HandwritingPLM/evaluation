Opinion (Bernays, 1955, p. 22). Bernays (1953) reiterates the significance of propaganda in influencing establishment regarding his phrase, "And it is careful planning done beforehand whether good-time hits or miss" (Bernays, 1955, p. 22). Furthermore, Bernays cautions against the public being manipulated. He claims, "The public is not a homogenous soceity advocating molded at will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, there are certain ways in which the public can be communicated with effectively. It must explain itself, its aims, and the benefits the partnership offers, in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept.

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in "Public Relations" (1942). Rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man can help his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or help the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 6). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of society but still acknowledges the possibility of manipulation of the public. Under this framework, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is more in ignorance of the public's opinion.

The theories developed by Lippmann, Laswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann and others are focusing attention on the fact that the public can be influenced by the media. Recent research has helped to understand the influence of the media on the public. The theories present different media models, suggesting that propaganda could directly influence public opinion. It was believed that the media might have broader effects than previously thought.

Despite the work of scholars like Lippmann, Laswell, Ellul, and Bernays, there is still much to be understood about the manipulation of the public. While the theories presented in the paper have been heavily debated, there is potential for future research in this area.
