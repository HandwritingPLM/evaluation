1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch. They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media use and audience:

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of mass media use is assumed to be goal-oriented. Patterns of media use are shaped by the audience's perception of what certain kinds of content have to offer.

2. In the mass communication process, much initiative is creative in linking need gratification with media choice by the audience member. This challenges any straightforward effect of media content on attitudes and behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by mass communication are only a segment of human needs, and their fulfillment can vary.

4. Methodologically, many goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves, suggesting that people are self-aware enough to report their interests and motives.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while exploring audience orientations on their own terms.

Additionally, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch noted that previous research on gratifications found diverse attractions to media but did not address the connections between these gratifications. They suggested that uses and gratifications research should focus on the social and psychological origins of needs that lead to differential exposure to media content and other activities, resulting in need gratification and other consequences, both intended and unintended.

Uses and gratifications emphasize the motives and self-perceived needs of audience members. Different individuals can use the same media content in various ways to fulfill their needs. There is not a one-size-fits-all approach to media use, as each individual's situation and preferences determine what they seek from media. Users are capable of recognizing and articulating their own motives and needs when engaging with media. Multiple media forms can satisfy different needs for different users, reflecting the diversity in audience motivations.

Media-People Interactions proposed by McQuail, Blumler, and Brown in 1972 identified four important media gratifications to help classify audience motives and behaviors.
