Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structuralist linguistics. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two interconnected systems: langue and parole. Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which composes it. In contrast, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structural level, langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society that is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract that one must accept entirely to communicate. Because language is a system of contractual values, it resists modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language to express their personal thoughts. Speech corresponds to an individual act rather than a pure creation.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form, while the form is the signifier, the external part of language. Saussure argues that language constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences. Meaning is produced through a process of selecting and combining signs along two axes: the syntagmatic (e.g., sentences) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system. Signs are related to each other through these axes, generating meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
