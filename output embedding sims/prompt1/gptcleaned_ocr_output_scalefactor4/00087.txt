An well-educated observational theorist developed through the lens of psychology did Soe. Carrying over 200 years. With acquired insights as well as exploring more varied fields in these disciplines, researchers select avenues of higher concepts of understanding media. A sub-tradition of media effects research, uses and gratifications approach has been suggested to be originally derived from a functional paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory on communication agrees with certain effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the study, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that the mass media have a direct, immediate, and influential effect on audiences by "injecting" information into the so-called heads of "the public" (Watson & Hill, p. 105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1960s. After that, a shift which examined the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishing modes of use and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media for almost as long as communication research is dated back to the 1930s. Going back to the 1940s, researchers became interested in the reasons for using different media genres, such as soap operas and quiz shows, and selling newspapers (Schramm, Lyle, and Hovland, 1944). In these studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al. 1973). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their audience's need for warmth, humor, or escape, rather than for informational purposes. Segregation was also discovered to provide a sense of security, shared participation, and a structured sense of community (Berelson, 1964). For these diverse dimensions of usage satisfaction, psychologists Herzberg (1966) associated them with the term "gratifications."

The study and practice of the uses and gratifications approach became increasingly well-known within academia by the late 1960s. This approach was further popularized when it was rediscovered during that era by a group of scholars who focused on uses and gratifications research. Elihu Katz emerged as a pioneering media sociologist and a prominent researcher. He received his Ph.D. in sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1987. Over the past thirty years, his work in the Department of Communication Studies has exceeded 80 books and articles. The founding of both Krasikov, and administrator interested in developmental psychology.

Katz's work was rewritten by Poel Lacanfeld, where he pointed out the importance of understanding the concept of gratifications with the functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced ideas in the gratifications approach when he came up with Bateson's concept that people are drawn to their biases in categories like culture. Katz believed that people aspire to their needs differently than they do to the needs of others and asserted that people more readily activate their needs than they consciously overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas, 1973).

Along with media researcher Jay G. Morrow, they published a collection of 1004 titled The Uses of Mass Communication, which was credited The Work Communication, They took a more audience-centric approach to looking at media. They argued that media should fulfill the needs of the audience if they achieve the desired impact on society. They also discussed the function of audience, selectivity, surveillance, and individual needs as well as media coverage and understanding.
