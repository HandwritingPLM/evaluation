Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in communication. The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to navigate uncertainty.

Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication. In the 1960s, based on the assumptions of Berlo and Calabrese, who were under the direction of Kurt Lewin, Leon Festinger, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research on social dynamics, had a substantial influence on interpersonal communication.

Festinger worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research Center for Group Dynamics, based at the University of Michigan, and then at Stanford University.

After graduation, many scholars initially followed his methods, which were highly influential. Turner (2000) reported that individuals can learn a lot from Festinger's influence.
