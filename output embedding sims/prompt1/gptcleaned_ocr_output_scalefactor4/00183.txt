Uses and Gratifications

1.1 Introduction

The uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original
conception of the approach was based on research explaining the great appeal of soap opera
television media genres. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media
and what do they use them for? (Katz 1985). There exists a basic idea in the approach: audience members seek media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.

In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice squarely on the side of audience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, i.e. they pay attention
to certain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users at opposed to
passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus
on “what media do to people” and assume audiences are homogenous, uses and gratifications
approach is more concerned with “what people do with media” (Katz, 1983). With audience's personal needs to use media and responses to the media, which are determined by
their social and psychological backgrounds. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
that the media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction. As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a
wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different.

The approach emphasizes audiences' choice by assessing their reasons for using
a certain media to the disregard of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained
from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin
& Tankard, 1997). A broad perspective among communication researchers, it provides an important tool for understanding the processes by which media participants seek
information or entertainment effectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Katz
et al., 1973). Audience members then incorporate the content to fulfill needs or to gratify their interests (Lowery & Matwa, 1983).

1.2 Origin and History

It is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psy-
chology and sociology over the past 100 years. With informed by valuable ideas as well as
exploring more unified fields in these academic disciplines, researchers took a series of higher
conceptions of understanding media.
