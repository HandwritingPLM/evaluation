1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

In interpersonal communication, initially focused on persuasion, theorists explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, initial judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2006). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology Played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research Pioneers such as Feingold, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of each scholar like Reape, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade and into the 1950s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Bernal, Realalt, and Berger became popular along with research on behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Augeon, and Patterson. Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past neo decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication trends focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, and communication as a function of developing relationships. Research in interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the developmental, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been posited that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a separate field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on those theories which coined the phrase of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and in general in our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct in the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this type of uncertainty in the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of IRT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) responded to this work by the information theorists as well as Heider's (1950) research on attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded the concept of uncertainty to interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the “number of alternative ways in which an interaction might behave" (p. 80). The presence of uncertainty diminishes the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions, individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Ferraris’ (1981) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of the processes when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternatives that a sender can help avoid potentially occur” Uncertainty plays a significant role in relationships as high levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Further, relationships may not be able to develop relationships or may not be able to maintain positive interactions. Wait and Tutter (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty cause clearer verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking. In interpersonal therapy, it is expected to decrease unpredictability with the goal that this will lead to the ability of individuals to predict what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty arises, it is often seen as a negative. Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty can lead to a lack of spontaneity and predictability in a relationship. Hoth and Bryan (2000) write: “Too much certainty and predictability can deaden a relationship.
