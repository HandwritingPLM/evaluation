Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. Saussure's linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which composes it; as opposed to it, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1967, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structural level, langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society by which it is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression of the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be separated from the shared convention, the structure. 

A language is therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing their personal thoughts. It is because speech is essentially a communicative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not a pure creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-75). 

Merging Saussure's language system into two parts, signifiant and signifi√©, Barthes expresses that ideas or meanings are expressed through the form of a sign. The signifier, which is the external part of language, dog in English or more an are the external forms which carry the actual internal the concept in question, hence. The signified "I propose to designate by 'idea' or 'meaning' and to replace concept and sound/image respectively" (Barthes). The last terms have the advantage of indicating the seres "in sem of the spec to each other and from the whole of which they are parts." The correspondence of the content, external parts of a sign, to the concept, internal parts of a sign, establishes a relationship, as argued by Saussure. According to Saussure, meaning is a process of selection and combination through the paradigmatic axis, NOTTS. Underlying systematic of language and the saussurian critique. (Barthes, 2002, p.15).
