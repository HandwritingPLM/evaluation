1. Return to Germany

were published without their permission in 1940. Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the 1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1964 Adorno published an essay that was the result of a study that had been done for the amusement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay, Adorno redefined modern mass culture as a medium of unparalleled psychological control (2001, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1960s that Adorno would delve into the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments (M4, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on certain attempts to reshape the industry. For example, in 1999 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture (21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1966 on the inh, when writing the essay Transparency in Film, Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1665, p. 151).

9. One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

alienated society into a systematic panacea, as opposed to Vijpershaus, 1994, p. 600). Instead of culture serving control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure can into mass society (Tbertz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalism formed a system of repressive containment (Alwoy, 2005, p. 583). The Lives Were inscribed in affection that kept elements of science off air and continue to perpetuate the impression. Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wonders whether the alienment aspects of mass media could be differentiated from their informational functions (Marcuse, 1001, p. However, it is difficult to separate culture or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno had done. In the end, Marcuse's analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant ideology. Marcuse wrote, â€œhow can the administered individual break make their way into their own consciousness and satisfactions and thus emancipate themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thinkable that the vicious circle be broken? (Hd 2001, p. 280). Given the pessimistic tone of the text, it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for Leftist movements of the 1960s in the US and Germany that developed an opposition to. In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated into practice (Chambe SIKH, p. 520).

In reviewing the text in 1961, Friedrich Pollock reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that the work required too much revision to pass dissemination. The two authors continued to negotiate with the Flecker publishing house until 1964 and may have only agreed to republish the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals.
