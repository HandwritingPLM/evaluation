Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation by speaking actors. The former is called "langue" and the latter "parole." Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signal that composes it, whereas speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structural level, langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society that is stabilized and standardized. In contrast, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is, therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language. It is essentially a collective contract that one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language to express their personal thoughts. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not to pure creation.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning that is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word "dog" in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. Saussure argues that language constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences. Meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g., a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms).

As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the game paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when they are related to each other. Meaning is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs. Saussure's argument emphasizes that signs derive meaning through their differences and their organization into a sequence within cultural conventions.
