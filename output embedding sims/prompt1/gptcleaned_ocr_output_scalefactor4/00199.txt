AND GREAT

Studied in a study by Katz, Blumer, and Curevitch in 1974 as follows: a framework for understanding the connection between media and audience. The audience is conceived as active, an important part of media, assumed to be goal oriented... patterns of media use are shaped by definite expectations of what certain kinds of media content have to offer to the audience member.

In the media, scholars have often theorized audience behavior. The media compete with other sources of information in the mass communication landscape, but audience engagement and the degree to which they can be influenced certainly vary.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves. In other words, people are aware enough to report their media use in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when presented in an understandable and familiar verbal format.

In addition, Katz, Blumer, and other researchers have detected the civil need for preferential media use.
