Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussurist ideas. Language commits to communication, indifferent to the material of the signified content. Barthes states, "Language is what covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes 187). There is a linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level of langue involves convention or value shared through society, which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible within shared convention, despite the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the language.

Language is regarded as a social institution and a system of values. It is the social component of language, essentially a collective contract that one must accept in its entirety to communicate. It resists modifications from a single individual as it is a social institution. In contrast, speech is an individual act of selection and actualization using the language code to express personal thoughts.

Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form, known as the signifier. The relationship between the concept and external form is arbitrary, not inevitable. Language constructs meaning from within itself through conceptual and phonetic differences. Meaning is produced through two axes: the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic.

The syntagmatic includes a sentence, while the paradigmatic comprises a field of possibilities where signs can be replaced. Signs create meaning through relations between each other, not referencing an independent objective world. The relations between signs generate cultural conventions within a particular context.
