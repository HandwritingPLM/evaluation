Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.

The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “I propose to retain the word sign (signe) to designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and signifier (signifiant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1859, in FL Innes field, p. 37). The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not in the destined relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1920) argues that "language does not reflect a preexistent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Saussure, “meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g. synonyms), organized into a signifying system" (Barker, 2002, p. 23). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, let's consider the leading sentence: “I went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through a linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as theater, my, and girlfriend can be substituted for by other signs in the base. 

Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure argues that signs do not make sense by virtue of reference to external reality, rather they gain meaning by reference to each other. Thus, meaning is a social convention organized through the relations between signs (Barker, 2002, p. 28). It is central to Saussure's argument that meaning is meaningful in relation to the differences recognized into a sequence which generates green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
