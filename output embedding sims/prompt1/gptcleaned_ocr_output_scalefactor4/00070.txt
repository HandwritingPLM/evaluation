Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in affecting public opinion (Bernays, 1935), Bernays (1985) himself made a statement regarding his purpose, the art of content. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time bits of mass publicity and propaganda (Henares, 1986). Furthermore, Bernays' theories also represent a different view of the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928). Instead, Bernays (1938) offers the idea that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain, its aims, its objectives, to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept.

Bernays elaborates on these basics in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, and helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1985). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of society, but still claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, propaganda is important because it helps them understand the society of which we are all a part, know and evaluate the viewpoints of others, exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, evaluate efforts being made by others, and persuade or suggest courses of action. Within this framework, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of public opinion. Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tend to disagree with this point.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons based on the idea of mass persuasion was able to bring attention to the fact that the public can be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more recent research aimed to help understand the media's impact on the public. Through the work of Jamieson and Cappella, Graber, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of the potential effects of techniques such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects that these techniques can have on their audience. The theories presented in this paper have tested both the direct effects and indirect effects of media models. Theorists such as Ellul believed in a model whereby propaganda could directly influence the thought process, while also Lippmann noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also influence what people think about. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of Iyengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the generalization of the public, and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
