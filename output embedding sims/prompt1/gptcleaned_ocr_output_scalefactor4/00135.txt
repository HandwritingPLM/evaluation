Defining Uncertainty

Communication initially focused on persuasion, research conducted under the title of interpersonal co: Re and small group processes. Theories supported omens y chance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005), Kurt Lewin, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Helder, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, influenced by the research of such scholars rational devel and relational control. This was the case, ein, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later Lai and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon,-Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or Scola a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is central in our understanding of interpersonal processes. 

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese adapted concepts from the information theorists as well as Heider research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions, individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac’s definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated; “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say" Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can cause stress and anxiety which can lead to low levels of communication. Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop re! Engaging interactions. West and Turner note that lower levels of uncertainty are expected to increase predictability with the goal that this will lead to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty exists, it is difficult to reach this goal. Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of it often and predictability can also inhibit a relationship. Heath and Bryant state, "Too much ven and predictability can deaden a relationship; sweet such certainty."
