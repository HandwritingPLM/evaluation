Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s until the 1970s when television has grown. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz served both as a sociologist and a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University, began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting.

In 1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania and also directed its Experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one of the pioneers of gratifications research.

Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the-induced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the.
