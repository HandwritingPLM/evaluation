CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing society (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss guileful intent propaganda (Bernays, 1935). Furthermore, Bernays theories represent a different perspective in opposition to Lippmann's view of the public as being easily molded or dictated to (Bernays, 1928). Instead, Bernays suggests that if attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be made amenable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, in the arena which the public understands and is willing to accept.

Bernays (1952) presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations of contemporary situations help the public adjust to it. He recognizes the power of possible, the limitations of the public, which we are all a part of, and the importance of being aware of the media's influence on the public.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories
Additionally, Ellul and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Lippmann also brings attention to the fact that people can be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues is essential in order to understand the influence of the media on the public. By having a more comprehensive understanding of the theories developed by Lippmann, Ellul, and Bernays, it helps us to understand the society we live in better.

The theories developed by Lippmann and Ellul are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of the press and the public, recent research work by Lasswell, White, Lewin, McCombs, and others has been developed. The public's understanding of gatekeeping, agenda setting, goal framing, and the agenda-political efforts that the media can have towards their audiences.

The theories propose mixed and limited effects on the media, influencing not only thoughts but also behavior. Several studies have demonstrated the limited effects of mass media, such as Lippmann and Bernays. Overall, the research on the media, propaganda, and public relations by scholars like Lippmann, Ellul, and Bernays has been very influential. This paper has shown the importance of the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, Ellul in understanding the society we live in today.
