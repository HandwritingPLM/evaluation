CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that the public is capable of being influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more recent research aimed at understanding the media's influence on the public. Through the work of theorists like Iyengar and Kinder, White, Dewey, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of the media has been developed. The public has now been made aware of media functions such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential impact these techniques can have on their audiences.

The theories presented in this paper have contributed heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects media models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to lean heavily towards the direct effects model, where propaganda could directly influence the thoughts of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists like Lasswell also noted that the media might not just be influencing thoughts, but also what people think about. This line of thinking led to a starting point for future research on the limited effects of the media. These limited effects were demonstrated through the work of Iyengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in this paper has been crucial in understanding the media, the manipulation of the public, and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul were formulated years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
