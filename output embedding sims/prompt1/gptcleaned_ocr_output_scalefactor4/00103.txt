Elihu Katz and his theories have developed through the realms of psychology and social sciences. Researchers were influenced by valuable ideas as well as exploring untilled fields in these areas. Kelly presented a series of higher conceptions of understanding media, originating from a functionalist and gratifications approach stemming from functional theory. This approach examines media's effects on people, emphasizing the injection of information into the consciousness of the masses. 

Studies during the 1940s explored the relationship between media and people, leading to the establishment of uses and gratifications approach. Researchers focused on gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media, dating back to the early days of mass communication research itself. These studies identified a list of functions served by specific content or the medium itself. For example, soap operas and newspapers were found to fulfill various needs, marked as "gratifications" by Herzog (1944).

Elihu Katz, a prominent figure in uses and gratifications research, made significant contributions to the structure of the approach. He introduced the notion that people use media to their benefit, connecting the concept of gratifications with the functional theory model. Along with colleague Jay G. Blumer, Katz published a collection of essays in 1974 which highlighted the humanistic approach to media use. They identified functions of media such as surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission for both society and individuals.
