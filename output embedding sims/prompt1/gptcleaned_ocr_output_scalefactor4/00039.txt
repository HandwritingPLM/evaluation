These preconditions Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industry are all important to an understanding of his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This is often referred to as Fordist capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 142). Examples of this, not specified by Adorno, were the Hollywood production system or the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any meaningful change to entertain and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno 2002, p. 106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles as someone who was allowed to break the rules; our studio created Citizen Kane on its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual.

The elasticity in the system would align with an example of erasing the stance of any opposition and make it.
