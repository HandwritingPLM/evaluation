1. Needs and Gratifications

Uses and graphics

Blumler and Nae emphasized that perceived needs of audiences vary, so very different people can use the same communication methods for different needs. There is not only one way to meet many different needs for different people.

Using the five main gratifications identified by Blumler and Katz, we see a focus on different matches between actual experiences, activities, and needs. That is, audience members vary in their desired gratifications and which media best meet their needs. Using different matches, motivations, and interactions can lead to different gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from reality; (2) Personal relationships: emotional release; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; (4) Surveillance (forewarn of environment).

Another subdivided variation of the audience's motivation was inspired by McGuire. He distinguished between two types of media: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" interaction, "external" versus "internal" orientation, and "growth" and "preservation" goals. These factors yield different types of motivations which apply to media. The structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation has been developed from these social and psychological studies, categorizing into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, or understanding.
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, or fantasy.
3. Personal integration needs, including social, status, or role identification.
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with others or finding friendship.
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Overall, McGuire's classification provides a framework for understanding common reasons for media use: finding out about relevant events and communications in immediate surroundings, society, and the world; seeking advice on practical matters or opinions and discussions; satisfying curiosity and general interest; learning and self-education; gaining a sense of security through knowledge.
