Uses and Gratifications

4.1. Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an alternative perspective in media research. The significance of the approach lies in understanding how individuals fulfill their needs through media consumption. Uses and gratifications theory puts the focus on the audience members, linking their needs and gratifications to their media choices. It explores how individuals select information based on their needs and interests, in contrast to traditional media theories that assume a passive audience receiving information.

The approach emphasizes audience choice by evaluating their motivations for using a particular media platform over others, as well as the gratifications they derive from it based on their individual social and psychological needs. From a broader perspective in communication research, it offers a framework for understanding how media users selectively seek information or content that aligns with their needs and interests. Audience members then integrate this content to meet their needs or fulfill their interests.
