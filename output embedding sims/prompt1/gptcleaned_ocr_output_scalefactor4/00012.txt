Aloha, as astute scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. Saussure's mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the parole. Parole is peer to the latter; Langue is the systematized set, indifferent to the material of the signal which is speech. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The social convention or value shared through a society is the structural level. Since it is the actual expression at the individual level, it is more flexible.

Language is therefore, a social institution and system of values. It is a collective contract one must accept entirely to communicate. Because language is a system of contractual values, it resists modifications from a single individual, making it a social institution. In contrast, speech is an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the language code to express personal thoughts. Speech corresponds to an individual act, not pure creation.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes between the signified and the signifier. The signified is the concept or meaning expressed through the form, which is called the signifier. Both the word "dog" in English and the equivalent in Korean are external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Saussure argues that language constructs meaning through conceptual and phonic differences within itself.

Language does not reflect pre-existent external reality but constructs meaning through a series of differences. Meaning is a result of the selection and combination of signs along syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes. The syntagmatic axis refers to the systematic order within a sentence, while the paradigmatic axis refers to the selection of signs within a particular context. The selection is regulated by linguistic community consensus.

For example, the syntagmatic and paradigmatic elements can be seen in a sentence like, "She went to a restaurant with her mother." This sentence could be replaced with another, like "She went to a theater with her girlfriend." The syntagmatic order and the difference between signs create meaning within a context.
