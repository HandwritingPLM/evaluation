1. Return to Germany

When their works were published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing themselves from their own work in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late 1940s, the Institute relocated to Frankfurt and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954, Adorno published an essay entitled "How to Look at Television," which was the result of a study conducted for the Hacker Foundation with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay, Adorno warned that rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed psychological control. It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s that Adorno discussed the implications of mass culture. Despite this, Adorno occasionally attempted to reshape his thoughts on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote about a universal pseudo-culture in the United States and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on "The Culture Industry Reconsidered." In 1966, when writing the essay "Transparencies on Film," Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry within the context of modernism.

2. One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse provided an analysis of late capitalist society in a systematic context, as opposed to other writers in the Frankfurt School. Instead of culture serving ideological ends, Marcuse believed that social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensured the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society. Capitalist production and the resulting wealth formed a system of repressive affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent. Society had become organized around an ideology aimed at maintaining social control and perpetuating the ideology that sustained that control. Marcuse, echoing Adorno, questioned whether the information and entertainment aspects of mass media could be distinguished from their manipulation and indoctrination functions. However, in Marcuse's argument, it is challenging to separate culture or mass media from society as a whole since he did not differentiate culture or mass media as entities separate from the dominant ideology in the same way Adorno did. In the end, Marcuse's analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant ideology. Despite being perceived as an icon for leftist movements of the 1960s in the U.S. and Germany, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher and not an activist. Similar to others associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated into practice. When reviewing the text in 1961, Friedrich Pollock reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that the work required significant revision to receive mass dissemination. The two authors continued negotiating with the Fischer publishing house until 1969 and may have agreed to republish the work only because pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals.
