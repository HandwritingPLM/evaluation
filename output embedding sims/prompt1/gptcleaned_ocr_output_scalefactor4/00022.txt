INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

THE CULTURE
Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with more correlative in Europe. The choicest thing in Adorno's experience with the advertising industry in the United States was fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical division of consumers, noting that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political propaganda [Horkheimer and Adorno did not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop a relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception
For Adorno, popular culture was not viewed as art. They were instead deemed as mass deception, with intent to intentionally produce trance-like states. There was a removal of context, content, signification, and hierarchy (Hohendahl, 2002, p. 5). This view is supported by Horkheimer and Adorno, who believed that the dominant culture in the industry works to suppress alternatives.

Adorno pointed out that the dominant culture in the industry serves as an opposing force to the culture industry, and specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry.

Through his work, Adorno provides not only a critique of the culture industry but a defense of high art, specifically defining avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry. 

Given this, Adorno critiques the culture industry for being a destructive force to the culture, and an opposition to high art, making his work a defense of high art against popular culture [Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 7].
