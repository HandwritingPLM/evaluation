Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In other words, before we consider Adorno, who coined the term, it is important to note that Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1924, and the two theorists became friends. Adorno was deeply affected by the death of Benjamin, who introduced a critical version of his ideas in academic philosophy. The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Moving to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the University, starting his fight against censorship that led to the formation of the Marxist party in September 1979. The rise of power of the Marxist party also influenced Adorno's philosophical thought. Benjamin had a more optimistic view of mass culture compared to Adorno, as propaganda and entertainment became more dominant in the 1930s. Adorno challenged the idea that music and literature could be commercialized, supporting the mechanical reproduction of art. While Benjamin believed that the mechanical reproduction of music and the changes in listening habits undermined original artwork, Adorno saw the challenge as an opportunity to rethink the relationship between art and mass culture. Adorno's work with the Institute continued with social research projects with Columbia University. Adorno later claimed that his disagreement with Benjamin was only minor, highlighting the importance of their collaboration in redefining cultural norms in the United States. Benjamin and Adorno's different perspectives on the impact of mass culture and the mechanical reproduction of art were instrumental in shaping critical theory in the Frankfurt School.
