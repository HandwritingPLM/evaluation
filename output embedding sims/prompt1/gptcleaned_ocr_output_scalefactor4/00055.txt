Linguistic mechanism by speaking actors. The former is called by Saussure Structural linguistics. On two levels, the Systematic system and the Variation. Langue and the latter parole. Langue is necessary to communicate that corresponds to it.

Speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, langue, is the social convention or value shared through society which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level.

It is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention. The structure of language is, therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to. It resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, Speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not a pure creation.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two halves, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified.

The correspondence of the concept meaning to the form presents a relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation relation, but rather, the arbitrary relation. It is not does between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure perceives tangible sounds, not mental images of independent objects, but as a series of conceptual and phonic differences. According to Saussure, Meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic. The syntagmatic comprises a sentence, organized into a signifying system. The paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities In selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, the syntagmatic means a linear combination of signs that is realized only when other signs in the paradigmatic are substituted for by others. Thus, meaning is understood as a convention organized through the relations between signs.
