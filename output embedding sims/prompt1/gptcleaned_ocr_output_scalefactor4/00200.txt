Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

The idea of a concern with culture is developed through insights into the mechanical reproduction ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music but also to Hollywood movies. Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno became Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin's death, "it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy." The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his departure from Germany but also affected his philosophical thought.

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frankfurt School colleagues. Already in the late 1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. The essay translated as "On the Fetish Character in Music and the Regression in Listening" is, in effect, a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more optimistic essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction."

Adorno's primary problem lay in the fact that symphonic works could now be heard over the radio and reproduced on phonograph records, resulting in inferior quality. Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music. While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project, Adorno looked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.

In 1938, Max Horkheimer established a relationship for the University that enabled the Institute to continue working in.istributed in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno became Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin's death, "it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy." The relationship with Benjamin had on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Adorno began teaching at the Institute. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his departure from Germany but also affected his philosophical thought. The general attitude of the Frankfurt School was that of Adorno.

In 1941, Adorno wrote for the Project's journal, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live performance. He questioned the claim by the radio industry that it was bringing serious music to the masses. While he claimed to not know what a "radio project" was, he looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music.
