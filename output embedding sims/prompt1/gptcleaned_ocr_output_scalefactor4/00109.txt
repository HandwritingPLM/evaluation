1. Needs and Gratifications theory emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Media content may serve as a escape for people or fulfill various needs for individuals who use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users. Situational factors, such as the context, and the individual's background, such as experience and education, determine what they want from media and what factors influence their media choices. Researchers like Jean Paiste believed that people are aware of and can state their own needs, and categorize them. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown proposed a model called "media-person interactions" to classify four important media gratifications.
