The following theories significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
The manners of tasks work. can be seen reflected in the observations of Berger and Calabrese (1975)

1.1) Leon Festinger (1919-1999)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had an

Interpersonal communication and on the development of WRT encoding
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social norm (Congratree cognitive dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewis foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1702). CDT allows for three
cognitive dissonance relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
dish, in which cognitions are in competition with each

wed siblings, To evaluate a cli, the individual
will seek the opinions of others who are similar to the self, This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1974) related so-
cial comparison to CDT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others
who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist Award from the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger’s legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. As one
Festinger, (SRO stated, “It was in his era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has never been the same since” (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1958)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz. During his time in
Europe, Heider worked with prominent psychologists such as Wolfgang Köhler, Max Wertheimer,
and Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as having a substantial impact on his life: “I want
to pay tribute to Lewin's stimulating influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which is
still strong even in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work” (Heider, 1928, p.).
In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of
Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, SRT.
