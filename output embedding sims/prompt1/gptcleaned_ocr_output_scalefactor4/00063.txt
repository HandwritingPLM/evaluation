Research into interpersonal communication theory typically addresses Initiation, Maintenance, and Dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized
Since its introduction in 1960s. Motivated by Uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975), Uncertainty has been a prominent field of study that has

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important concept, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the "number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of
predicting present and past behaviors but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradacâ€™s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say." Uncertainty becomes evident in communication relationships.
High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can cause stress and anxiety, which can lead to low levels of communicator competence Chia ron t a
Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop trust or may hesitate to engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) state that with high uncertainty exists it is often
difficult to what will occur in future interactions.  

Increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased uncertainty with a high uncertainty exists observed in individuals are expected to increase predictability with what will occur proposed of difficulties with what will occur in future interactions. High levels of certainty inhibitions of the relationship can also inhibit a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: "Excessive predictability can"
