4. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1) Needs and Gratifications

The Needs and Gratifications approach interprets motives and the impact of media on the audience. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different media content meets different needs for individuals. The same media content may satisfy different needs for different individuals. There is not only one role that people use media. There are as many reasons for using media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Social situation, individual background, such as experiences, interests, and education, shape people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. In other words, audience members are aware of and can articulate their own motivations and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interaction" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release, (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: preference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance [source of information].

McQuire (1974) suggested that the audience's motivation was influenced by a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotional stability of "growth" and "preservation." When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of gratifications which apply to media use. 

Figure 1 shows a breakdown of 16 general paradigms of human motivations (McGuire, 1974). Wimmer, Gurevitch, and Hass (1973) developed 04 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;

2. Affective needs, including emotions, pleasure, feelings;

3. Personal integrative needs, including nudging and social ties;

4. Social integrative needs, including associating with family and friends; and

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Similarly, McGuire's (1983) classification of the following common reasons for media use:

* Finding out about current events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world.

* Keeping abreast on practical matters or for entertainment and escape.

* Finding escape and personal interest.

* Meeting a sense of security through knowledge.
