were published with their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing
themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late
1950s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises on Leo. Horkheimer
became the Vice Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of work that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned that rigid institutional reforms modern mass culture into a mode of widespread
psychological control (Adorno Vis, pp. 68). Up to a few occasions in the 1930s that Adorno would address the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the times (Jager, SMM, p. 80). Adorno did nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1968 he wrote for a universal periodical
in the United States (Adorno, 1990, p. 21), and gave a video talk in Germany in 1970 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay "Transparencies on Film,"
Adorno conceded that filmmaking might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of mind (Hohendahl, 1996, p. 11).

2. One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society in a systematic context, a purpose to
1 Wiggershaas, LH, 69). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms it advanced Lukewarm poetry and
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Beitr, 2000, p. 18). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
effluence that kept society subdued and quiescent (Alway, 1997, pp. 81). The
entirety of society had become an annulment of technology whose main objectives were to
maintain social control and could be perpetuate in a way that maintained that control. However, Adorno was worried whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from the manipulative and indoctrinating functions
(Marcuse, 1964, p. 81). However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture or art from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or art
inherently separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end, Marcuse's analysis of society revealed no opposition to the dominant
logic. Marcuse wrote, "Where can the people stand. is the very idiosyncrasy their curse? Can
they free themselves on their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce on an enlarged scale liberate themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? Is there
not even thinking alike in the victims circle to be broken? (Marcuse, 1981, p. 250). Given the pessimistic tone of the book,
it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist
movements of the time in the US and Germany that developed an oppositional stance.
In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others
associated with the Frankfurt school, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated
into practice (Chambers 2004, p. 14).
In reviewing the book in 1959, Fred Pollack reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that the
work required slight revision to receive German dissemination. The two authors partnered, began
negotiations with the Fischer publishing house of SH, and may have only agreed to republish
the work since pirate copies had already been distributed by individuals.
