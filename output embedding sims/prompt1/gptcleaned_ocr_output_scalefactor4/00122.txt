CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding the importance of Bernays' perspective on public opinion, it is clear that careful planning distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit-or-miss publicity and propaganda. Bernays cautions against viewing the public as easily predictable and advocates for businesses to study and explain themselves to the public in understandable terms. Instead of manipulating the public, businesses should seek mutual beneficial partnerships with the public. Bernays presents public relations as a tool for combining the perspectives of the public and the persuader, helping to adjust to contemporary situations. While manipulation of the public is still possible, it should not be done in blatant ignorance of public opinion.

The theories developed by Lippmann, Tasswell, Bilal, and Bernays are important for understanding how the public can be influenced by the media. Recent studies have shown that the media's influence can vary based on different factors. Scholars such as Lippmann and Ellul have differing views on the potential effects of media manipulation on public opinion. While propaganda can influence public opinion, it is crucial to understand the limitations of media effects. These theories continue to help us understand how media manipulation can shape public opinion and society.
