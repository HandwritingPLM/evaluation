Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1931. He earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea. The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creates applications of diffusion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2003 because he was suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.
According to Rogers (2003), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation is an idea, process, or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409). That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass communication, people can get information about an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Laswell presented a well-defined model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-R-E (Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver-Effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-R-E communication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally (5) effects can be individual's adoption of social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1) the innovation-decision process; (2) Innovativeness; (3) an innovation's rate of adoption. Most innovations have an S-shaped curve of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted for expanding the variables that influence how and why users or audience adapt new information or ideas, such as technology gain efficiency. That is, if more people see, feel, or pace theory, new technology can diffuse practical things, but the copy or tag line is that there are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process. According to innovation, they are: Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards. Adoption depends on people deciding to adopt the innovation. Implementation is reinforcing or standardizing the practice. Lastly, the dissonance is spreading and evolving.
