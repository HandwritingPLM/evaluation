Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition of media research. The original conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the broad appeal of certain media contents. The core question of media research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1952). There exists a basic idea in this approach that people choose content, and which media they use to meet their needs.

This approach entails what gratifications the media user seeks. It transcends traditional perspectives in that it regards audiences as active participants rather than passive consumers of information. In contrast to traditional media theories that inquire "what media do to people" and assume audiences are passive, uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). It highlights personal reasons to use media and respond to their need, which are influenced by individual and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates that different media platforms and content are consumed in a variety of ways as people engage with media to address various needs.

Different categories have emerged due to varied uses of media content such as Arousal, Personal Identity, and Information Seeking. These perspectives play crucial roles in the discipline. Recognizing the significance of utilitarian and hedonic motivations in media use is essential for understanding audience motivation for using media. Researchers have identified a range of benefits associated with media consumption.
