One of his works focused on diffusion theory and its applications in various fields like biology, political science, and previously unknown information. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2X due to kidney disease. He died on October 1, 20%.

According to Rogers (HAG), diffusion refers to the process of spreading ideas or innovations over time among the members of a social system as they are adopted. The process involves interaction between individuals and interpersonal communication. By sharing communication channels, one communication partner can pass on information and perceive its innovation as useful. Later (1946) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, B-H-C-R-E fig. Furthermore, Rogers (195) mentioned, "The 3-M-C-BrB communication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion." In the diffusion theory, various factors like innovativeness, an innovation's rate of adoption, and interpersonal influence contribute to the diffusion process.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, including (1) Innovators, (2) Early Adopters, (3) Early Majority, (4) Late Majority, and (5) Laggards. Rogers defined this term as the degree to which an individual adopts new ideas earlier than others based on innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Innovations spread through society over various periods of time in an S-shaped curve. Different generations or groups can have their own unique adoption patterns. Rogers also highlighted five key decision-making stages in the innovation process, including knowledge, attitudes, adoption, implementation, and confirmation.
