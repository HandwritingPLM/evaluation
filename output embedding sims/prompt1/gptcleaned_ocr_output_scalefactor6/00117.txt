Rogers was born in Cannel, Iowa in 1931. He earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, in 1964, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Rome. The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and its applications in such fields as geography, commerce, psychology, political science, and communication. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2006. According to Rogers (1983), diffusion refers to "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system." An innovation can be perceived as useful by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process. According to Innovativeness, "1 Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (deliberate), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)" (Rogers, 1983, pp. 189-198). Rogers defined his term as "the degree to which an individual can be relatively earlier in adopting a new idea than other members of his social system" (Rogers, 1962, p.40). Figure 1 shows the relationship between types of adopters based on innovativeness and their position on the adoption curve. Also, these categories follow a standard deviations curve which is bell-shaped. Figure 2 illustrates how an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in an S-shaped curve. However, since different types of innovators exist, the rate of adoption is faster than that of the laggards. Nevertheless, the decision-making process is difficult.

1. Knowledge (collective exposure and awareness of innovation)
2. Persuasion (people form positive attitudes towards innovations)
3. Decision (people decide to adopt the innovation)
4. Implementation (regular or standard practice)
5. Confirmation (comparing and evaluation)
