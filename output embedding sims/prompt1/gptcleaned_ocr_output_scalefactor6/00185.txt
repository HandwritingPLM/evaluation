I complained to the dean about the skeptical students in his class who were making teaching impossible. In the winter semester of 1978 students opposed a number of courses at the University of Frankfurt, including the Institute in Social Research. I tried to implement a new seminar on teaching, but the students continue to resist and be difficult. Apparently, Ferdinand de Saussure and the Neo-Adonian debt are very disappointing. 

Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

A special kind of trap has been set if we are to accept it in its entirety. Several German critics especially those of the right have also converged on Culture Industry. It is the opinion even of those farthest right that the aggressive powers of the totalitarian parents the culture of sexual repression, and exploitation by stultifying entertainment are major elements of contemporary capitalism. The culture Industry, though, is esteemed by the hoi polloi in flattering terms. It imitated the existing type of film and proved to be as popular as its models and, indeed, was studied by critics of the most widely different schools in detail.
