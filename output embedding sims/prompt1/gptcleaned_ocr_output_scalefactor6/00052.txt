Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.
The following chapters explore how communication can be a vehicle for individuals within or to reduce.

1. Early Influences

These findings then significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1944, he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. Following Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research. Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and in the development of WRT. Festinger is best known for the theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) explained how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual, a concept Lewin foreshadowed in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups. CDT allows for three relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in balance with each other, a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other, and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions involved have no effect on one another. Cognitive dissonance theory focuses on the themes of arousal and discomfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison Theory postulates that individuals look for feedback from others to evaluate themselves, seeking the opinions of others who are similar when facing uncertainty. Festinger received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's legacy is significant, and his theoretical influences can still be recognized in contemporary social science research.

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1985)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in psychology from the University of Graz in Austria. Heider worked with many psychologists and philosophers such as Maria Kafert and Max Wertheimer. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin's substantial impact on his work. In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later at the University of Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life.
