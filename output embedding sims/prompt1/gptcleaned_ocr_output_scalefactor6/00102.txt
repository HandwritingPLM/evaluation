1. WEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Needs and Gratifications

The Uses and Gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Bueler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may have different effects for different individuals. There is yet another way that people use media. There are many reasons for using the media. There are media workers (Blumler & Katz, 1971). 

Basic needs, social evaluation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and evaluation, shape people's desires about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their core motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumer, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" that classifies four important media gratifications: 1) Diversion or escape from routine or programs; emotional release; 2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; 3) Personal identity and reference; activity participation; value confirmation; and 4) Surveillance (forms of information-see reg). 

Another sub-debate on audiences' motivations was suggested by Peracalone (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: Cognitive and affective. Then he attached three criteria: "external" goal orientation, activities as "internal" goal orientation, and emotional stability of reactions and "preservation. When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). A ranking of 14 perceptual conditions of human motivation (McQuire, 1978). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, and escape;
3. Personal integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends;
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with society and culture; and
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Conclusively, McQuail's (1974) implications of the following core reasons for media use:

- Finding out about broad events and conditions;
- Handling immediate personal problems and escape from them;
- Seeking advice or counseling on personal matters or opinions;
- Identifying with and perceiving others;
- Self-education;
- Gaining a sense of security;
- Finding models of behavior;
- Identifying with parallel situations beyond their personal experiences;
- Gaining insight or a sense of involvement in events.
