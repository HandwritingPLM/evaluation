Needs and Gratifications

The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of mass media who is
critical in the goal-oriented... patterns of media use and shaped by more or less
definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience
in terms of.


In the mass communication process, much initiative in finding real gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
the theorizing about any form of straightforward effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior.


The media compete with other sources of entertainment. The task seemingly
taken by mass communication constitutes but a segment of the wider range of basic needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through various media forms
certainly varies.


Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - i.e., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
clear, understandable formulations.


Value should be observed over the cultural significance of mass communication
while audience particularities are expounded in a clear manner. (pp. 15-17).


In addition, Katz, Gurevitch, and Gurevich also commented that although previous researches on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people, they did not adequately analyze the
connection between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974). They suggest that needs and gratifications
research concerns with the following aspects: “[1) the societal and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the myriad media or other sources which may provide (5) differential exposure (or engagement, in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
consequences, perhaps more pronounced ones” (Katz et al., 1974, p.20). The studies of Blumler and
Katz laid a theoretical foundation of blending the uses and gratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this has been strengthened and progressed. The current areas of uses and
gratifications, particularly as new media forms have emerged in an
electronic Information age when people have more options of media use.


Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audiences toward media content.
Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication media
for different purposes or in different ways, far different
effects, implying that there are countless diversities (Lardner & Katz, 1975) in each case.
Social status, situational factors, and the individual's background can significantly affect people's choices on what they want from media and which media sources they prefer in a variety of needs and gratifications
For using different media, McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “multi-person
interactions” to them. Four important key gratifications are:
