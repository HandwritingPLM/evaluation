1. Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

The 1872 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the Culture Industry outside of a German context. In the years after, E.T.A Hoffmann argued that the new artarten had absorbed a “sweetness of art and edification, the time of the unhealthy beauty of melodious contradiction, the true substance being dismissed as merely beautiful and privileged.” While Hoffmann's contentions were far less sophisticated and well-founded than Adorno's seminal revelations about “the commodified character of cultural goods” (Gendle, 2008, p. 113). For the most sympathetic Deborah Gork, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1964, p. 4).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominance of ideology, his view that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton, 1981, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs among oppressed peoples in society has an impact to play in the reproduction of the system as a whole” (Eagleton, 1994, p. 0). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno's analysis of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that engaged in the 1960s and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s. While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial society between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohndorf, 1995, p. 1468). Thus, for some critics, the value of the concept of the culture industry appears to be merely historical as they indeed admitted that it had any value at all.

The assertion that contemporary culture was created by a few mass media may now accept differing ideological, political, and economic positions. As noted in the introduction part of the introduction to a special issue of socialism, A. B. Cultural Industries, television, and publishing company was wholly owned by the corporate America. 

There remain fundamentally few discrepancy En the once- accepted acres of these socialists in relation to the mareanatus, ideology. As noted, ideology Works in tandem with Commercial enterprise. The idea of the culture industry has had a significant impact on critical as well as theoretical debates about the role of mass communication in shaping ideological representation, and in shaping generalizations about the impact of free culture. On the other hand, Adorno did not systematically explain how the culture Industry Operates -whereas for Vogel to help me explore the idea of a culture Industry.

In the beginning, Adorno's "the culture corporation" argued that cultural products were all controlled by large corporations that mainly cared about profit. It also found that television was increasingly controlled by corporations and characterized by the unidimensional kind of commercial entertainment. As a result, its impact was more ideological than aesthetic. This perspective intersects with Larrain's concern with capitalist media, which is also, media shapes the way we view the world. 

Overall, the cultural companies operating today emphasize profit and business. For example, corporations like Apple thrive on advertisement and promotion in order to increase demand and revenue, thus affecting the way our lives and our views are shaped.
