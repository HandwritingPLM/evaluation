Folk needs and gratifications: Five basic assumptions were stated in a study by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows:

Theory piece 2: Take k for understanding the correlation between Peer and audiences:

The audience 1 Core see as exile, Le an Loria! [aeT r Mees mecha woe is ISSUE to be pitale eed... ASPECTS of media fee are shaped by more of These definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience member

In the mass communication process, the initiative and need for practical and diverse choices lie with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on audiences as a whole

The tied connection with other sources of needs suggests that the needs served by mass communication contribute to a subset of the wider range of human needs, and the extent to which they can be adequately met varies between individuals. Consumption certainly varies

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - i.e., people are sufficiently self-aware to be able to interpret their interests and motives in particular cases or at least to recognize them when presented with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also compared previous researches on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people to the media; they did not lack what connections between these gratifications [Katz et al., 1974]. They experienced that Uses and gratifications research concerns with the following aspects: (1) the social and the psychological origins of (2) needs which generate (4) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) differential exposure [or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other consequences, perhaps mostly integrated once (Katz et al., 1974, p. 20). The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of broadening the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, the research on this subject has been hidden and seen. The research of uses and gratifications is still because Katz's first analyzis, particularly as New Media Forms have emerged in such an electronic information age when people have more options of reliance

Uses and Gratifications:

The uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived media of audience members. Blonder and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for different purposes. The same media content may satisfy different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Conversely, there are as many reasons for use as there are users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Age, social situation, and the individual's background, each have different and equal influences on how and why media are used and how needs are met

for using different media pieces. Further, Blumler and Katz (1974) presented a model of "the personal LE PTO 2s ee Re PDT gee trees"
