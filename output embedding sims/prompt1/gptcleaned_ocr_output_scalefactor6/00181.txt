Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to understand the main ideological elements of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception, the concept can be traced through its genesis, from its emergence through Benjamin's generation, to its subsequent influence. The culture industry poses a significant impact. The idea of production of culture, leading to a wide-range of mass produced cultural products, raises challenges for mapping its revolutionary movements. Therefore, there is a growth in the interaction and understanding of the culture industry through different generations. 

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and they later became friends. Since Adorno did not receive a degree, the world allowed him to research at a university, making him Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin's death, Adorno introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy. The relationship with Benjamin had a significant impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Adorno began teaching at the Institute, and was given the right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party in Germany, which also influenced his philosophical insights. Adorno's work was later influenced by factors such as Stalinist repression and the commercialization of mass culture in the United States.

Adorno went to Oxford in 1954 due to the increasing persecution by the Nazis, where he worked on examining the works of Kant. He was considered a major figure in the field of Modernist critical theory, attracting followers from around the world. Adorno expressed his interest in mainstream culture such as film and radio becoming more popular throughout the 1930s. Adorno's work was influenced by the rise of Fascism, as well as by other factors such as censorship and suppression of arts and culture. Adorno's critique was focused on the reproduction of culture in an industrialized society, arguing that mechanical reproduction had drawbacks, and that original works could not be truly replicated. He emphasized the importance of authenticity in art.

To Benjamin, the historical shift from the original artwork to its mechanical reproduction was seen as decreasing the aura of authenticity surrounding the original piece. Adorno also explored the destruction of aura as a crucial element in understanding how hierarchy affects authenticity. For Adorno, the contrast between the reproduction of art in modern industrial society and the original work maintained a certain sense of separation and authenticity.
