Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure, the linguistic mechanisms operate on two levels, the systematic level opening a chain of conventions necessary for communication. Language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. Unlike language, which is a behavior system, speech is essentially an individual act of selecting and actualizing. 

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not in the destined relation. Saussure argues that meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic. Signs do not signify by virtue of the reference to an independent object but generate meaning through relations with each other. This central to Saussure's argument that meaning is not inherent between signs but is culturally constructed based on the relations between signs.
