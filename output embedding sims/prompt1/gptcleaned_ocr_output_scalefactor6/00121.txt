We accepted that communication through the media plays an important role in the field of psychology and social sciences. Communication serves a variety of functions and gratifications that are originally derived from a social context. For instance, functional theory of communication focuses on how communication affects users and how it influences the formation of opinions and attitudes. The study of communication from the 1960s onwards has highlighted a relationship between media and user preferences.

The exploration of gratifications that people seek in media can be traced back to communication research literature. Researchers have identified various functions served by specific content or user needs. Soap operas, for example, are believed to provide social support and emotional connections to listeners. Researchers like Herzig have associated these functions with the term "gratification."

Scholars and practitioners agree that communication research in the late 1800s laid the foundation for the field's future development. Researchers focused on understanding the needs of users and the growth of communication technology to establish the importance of audience perception.

Philip Cohen, an academic and communication researcher with a Ph.D. in Sociology from Colby University, began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1953. Over the next thirty years, he taught sociology and communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the early 1960s, he collaborated with George Gerbner to study the impact of television broadcasting. This collaboration led to further research on the effects of media on individuals' behavior and perceptions.

Their influential work generated new insights that contributed to the development of communication theory. Later, they introduced concepts and graphical approaches to better understand the interaction between media and audience preferences. A study conducted by Cohen, Gerbner, and Hoge in 1973 explored the use of media in church settings. The study revealed the importance of media content in shaping individuals' beliefs and behaviors.

In conclusion, their research emphasizes the role of media in shaping societal norms and values. By examining the relationships between different forms of communication, scholars have identified the future implications of surveillance and control in society.
