Uncertainty Reduction

In Advances in Interpersonal Communication, Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese, and Key Secretary Theres

the people at one bar examined a group of people at one bar. Specifically, they

explored the factors associated with reducing uncertainty between people that

could arise from communication. They found that

uncertainty could be reduced through goal-setting

activities by pretending that people were communication effectively.

By interpreting people's

behavior as a pattern

of communication, individuals could

better understand a person's intentions and

motivations in a specific situation.

The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Various scholars have contributed significantly to the field of interpersonal communication research. 

Some key figures include Moreland and Mayer.

These scholars have focused on understanding the ways in which individuals engage in communication to build relationships

and create meaning in various contexts.

They have explored the impact of

nonverbal cues, cultural differences, and personal characteristics on communication

effectiveness.

Overall, their research has provided valuable insights into the

complexities of human communication and

how individuals can better communicate with one another to

build stronger relationships and

achieve mutual understanding.
