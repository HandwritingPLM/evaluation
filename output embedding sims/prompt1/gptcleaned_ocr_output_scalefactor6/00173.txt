Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

On October 1, Adorno received the chair in musicology, the first ever in Germany, and planned to use the position to further his interests in cultural and political theory. What Adorno can provide, though his academic work in musicology, will support artists such as Toscanini, Schoenberg, and Berg in their efforts to refine musical techniques, giving the old forms new vigor.

At the beginning of the semester, Adorno left Germany and moved to Switzerland, where he taught musicology and composed a musical piece inspired by his experience in the Swiss Alps. Adorno's work in Switzerland laid the foundation for his future work in academic philosophy.

Adorno's years at Princeton and his eventual departure deeply affected his philosophical views, as Juergen Habermas later noted, causing Adorno to question his own identity and the significance of his role in academia. Adorno's work, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," is a key example of his evolving thoughts.

Adorno's passion for defending free thought and challenging hierarchical structures, shared with Walter Benjamin, led to a deep intellectual and personal connection between the two scholars. Adorno admired Benjamin's desire to break free from tradition and his commitment to critical theory, both of which resonated deeply with Adorno's own beliefs.

By recreating his image as a critical thinker, Adorno hoped to inspire others to challenge established norms and seek their own truth. Adorno's work at Princeton and his interactions with other intellectuals further shaped his ideas, contributing to his later work on the relationship between culture and society.

Adorno's continued pursuit of truth was evident in his later writings, which emphasized the importance of individual thought and the need for society to embrace diversity. Adorno's legacy continues through his students and colleagues, who carry on his intellectual tradition.
