Like many other structuralists theorists, Barthes was influenced greatly in linguistics.

To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels: the environment of sounds and the system of signs. The former is called parole and the latter, langue. Langue the system determines communication, independent of the material of the signal which corresponds to it. Speech is the product of language as a social dimension. The structure level functioning in the social context standardizes and organizes society. 

In this context, language is relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual can never be entirely free. It can have variations. 

A language is, therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the essential part of language. It has a subjective context where one must understand it entirely if one wishes to be coherent. It is a series of contracted values but with distinct modifications stemming from an individual, creating an entirely different level of language and actualization. 

Focus on the semiotic breed Saussure distinguishes the language itself in terms of points, icons, and indices. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form. The form is called the sign, which is the real part of language. For example, in the word "dog" in English or in any language, the eternal concept represents the actual meaning, the concept in question, becomes the signified. 

The correspondence of form concerning to the essence is not to be disregarded, but the interrelation between them is an inevitable internal relationship. The language does not matter, but the member should contain an ample scope of possible signs that can be selected in the system of language for a complete combination of signs. They range from the most primitive to the most complex.

Language is crucial, expressing both mathematical and symbolic. The perceiver is wise, engaging with modern theories yet embracing the enigma of language.
