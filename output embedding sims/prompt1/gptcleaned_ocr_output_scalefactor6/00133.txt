Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

He complained to the dean about the radical students in the classes who were making being inappropriate. In the winter and of 1966-1967 students occupied a number of buildings at the University at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research. After the strike ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, including one tasteless demonstration in which three females bared their breasts. Adorno died a few months later (Hager, 2004, p. 201-081).

1 Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since, there have been numerous criticisms of the text, most notably Adorno's sweeping generalizations about "the commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Osman, 1995, p. 46). Adorno's belief that "capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive cultural frivolity" (Osman, 1995, p. 46). Terry Eagleton conceded that "the distinction of certain values and oppressive people is integral to a culture industry was historically contingent with mass media went beyond the Culture. What the destiny of the culture is by Sandra Cu√±e Cesarque, a. 14605). Thus, for some critics, the value of modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles. However, in some cases, the dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of a culture industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s. Since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about the success of the film industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. It is clear that pictures are still made by large companies and that their movies largely help shape plots. It is also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by a small number of broadcasting bodies, which tend to impose restrictions on how stations can broadcast news, wine show programmers. For example, it happens that the commercial companies operating often do not continue to maintain a meteorological function. For example, one will not find a program on MSNBC or Yahoo that would question the prerogatives of corporate America. Discussing the role of the culture industry may be necessary in order to theorize on how mass communication media propagate dominant ideologies.
