It is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology over the past 100 years. Fueled by valuable ideas and exploring more specialized fields in these two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of media effects research, the uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally started from a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory on communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the theory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, intermediate and influential effect upon audience by injecting information into the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill, 1997, p. 106). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift that rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to the establishment of the uses and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as empirical mass communication research itself (Morley, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programs, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well as daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1999; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1988, etc.). In these studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 2003). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice, support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1988) rather than just offering information. Newspapers were also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and a structure to the daily routine (Herzog, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage and gratification, sociologist Herzog (1949) marked them with the term “gratifications”.

The uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s or early 1960s when television became popular. Some basic summaries of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz, who was a sociologist and a communication observer, stood out as one of the most well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz was trained both as a sociologist and as a communication observer. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1963. During the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about broadcasting and television in history, culture, and communication from the 1970s to 2006. In 2006, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania and also directed its postdoctoral scholar program.

Katz's main collaborator at the Hebrew University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who was one of the pioneers of gratifications research. Their cooperative work produced important categories that connect the concept of gratifications with the functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced the uses and gratifications approach when he came up with the notion that people use the media to their benefit. A study by Katz, Gurevich and Haer (1973) covered the reasons and motivations why people connect or disconnect themselves with each other through the media and found that people bend the media to their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haer, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which were titled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more human approach to looking at media. They argued that media could do not just as a mere source that best fulfills the needs of the user, and they have greater choices to satisfy those needs (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission for both society and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
