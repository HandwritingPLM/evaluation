1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of masking, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2006). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Hodder, Kelly, and Hovland. By the 1970s, researchers began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of scholars such as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Houser, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles. Burgoon, and Paterson. Banger (2005) states: “These early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda over the past few decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on traditional communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication affecting developing, sustaining, or dissolving relationships. Research into interpersonal communication typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is modulated by uncertainty (Berger & Calabrese, par. Since its introduction in the 1950s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is central to our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important concept in the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated and how it has been defined and conceptualized. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical frameworks of uncertainty theory. Shannon and Weaver first proposed that uncertainty related to the generation of entropy (NEED SOURCE). As their work was relatively early, many contributed to the development of uncertainty. Berger and others have researched the concept of uncertainty in interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as "the extent to which each interaction might be better" (p. LK). This question concerns the partner's reactions to one another and the chances individuals will be able to predict the reactions in their interactions. In interactions, individuals are faced with a range of possible outcomes, whether it is successfully explaining with their partner or miscommunication leading to confusion or discontentment (EATEN SOURCE). Berger's definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of learning from the large number of alternative possibilities. Winkler (2000) notes that lower levels of uncertainty can lead to increased interaction and closer relationships. When high uncertainty is present, it can lead to conflict. With work involving uncertainty, high levels of certainty can lead to stable relationships where partners can easily predict each other's behavior. Serafina and Thiessen (2002) argue that communication partners can create a harmonious relationship when predictions can be made about each other.
