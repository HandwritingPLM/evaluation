1. Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes that people use media content for different purposes. The same media content can gratify individuals in various ways, depending on their specific needs, social situations, and backgrounds. Factors such as experience, interests, and personal preferences influence people's ideas about what they want from the media they consume. Audience members can articulate their reasons for using different media outlets. McCuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important reception motivations: 1) Diversions escapades; 2) Personal relationships; 3) Personal identity; and 4) Surveillance.

Another nuanced version of audience motivation was suggested by Maslow (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective, adding dimensions such as "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and the dichotomy of growth versus preservation. These factors yielded 26 different motivational types applicable to media use (Figure 1). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1972) derived 35 needs related to the social and psychological functions of mass media.

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding
2. Affective needs, including relaxation, pleasure, feelings
3. Personal identity needs, including credibility, identity, self-esteem
4. Social integration needs, including interacting with family and friends, socializing
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion

Congruently, Perse (1985) classified the following common purposes for media use:

- Grasping current events and issues in immediate surroundings, society, and the world
- Seeking advice on practical matters or entertainment and lifestyle choices
- Satisfying curiosity and general interest
- Pursuing education
- Gaining reassurance and reducing anxiety
- Seeking role models of behavior
- Engaging with valued others in the media.
