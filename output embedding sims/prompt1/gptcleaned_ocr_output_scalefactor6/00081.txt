Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. First, they shed light on the idea that the public is often influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and Bernays also highlights the power of advertising and the impact of the media on the public. Through the work of figures like Ardoin, Wilts, Gwin, and Moss and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of the media has been developed. These theories have shown how the media functions as a tool for shaping, gathering, and presenting information, and the potential effects that these targeted campaigns can have on the perceptions of the masses. Critics such as Ellul have argued that the media does not always have a significant impact, but they can still influence and shape public opinion. This line of thinking has paved the way for future research in the area of the limited effects of the media. Researchers such as Lazarsfeld and Merton, as well as McQuail and Chaffee, have contributed significantly to our understanding of the manipulation of the public and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Laswell, Bernays, and Ellul were developed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that we live in today.
