NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevich as follows. They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media audiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, and an important part of mass media use is assumed to be goal-oriented...patterns of media use are shaped by many TSS definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience.

2. The most communicative process much initiative in linking need gratification and media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the degree in which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves. People are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. 

Furthermore, Katz, Blumber, and Gurevich also commented that, although previous research detected diverse gratifications that attract people to the media, they did not address the connections between these gratifications. They suggested that uses and gratifications research concern with the following aspects: â€œ(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2) needs which generate (2) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) differential exposure or engaging in other activities, resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other consequences, perhaps most the unintended ones." The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid the theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and gratifications is still based on Katz's early analyses, particularly as new media forms have emerged in such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use.

Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumber and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same media content for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users. Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as
