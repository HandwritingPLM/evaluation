Uses and Gratifications

41.4 Introduction

The uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of certain media content. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1980). There exists a basic idea in the approach: audiences members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs in the mass communication process. Uses and gratifications approach puts the function of linking needs gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members, as peopleâ€™s needs influence what media they would choose, how they use certain media, and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to passive receivers of information, contrasting with gatekeeping and agenda-setting theories which focus on "what media do to people" and assume audiences are homogeneous. The uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz 1955), and allows audiences personal meanings with media and responds to the media, which is determined by their social and psychological background. The uses and gratifications approach also postulates that the media compete with other information sources in audience's need satisfaction (Rafaeli et al. 1984). As traditional media and new media continue to provide people with a wide range of media platforms and content, the approach is one of the most appropriate perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be engaged in different media. The approach validates audiences' choice by assessing their reasons for using a certain media to the disadvantage of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Sreberny-Mohammadi & Khiabany, 1999). The study aims to provide a new understanding of the processes by which audience participants seek information or content selectively, consistent with their individual needs and psychological traits.

1.2 Origin and History

It is well-recognized that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology over the past 100 years. With valuable ideas coming from various academic disciplines, researchers have seen a sense of higher application and understanding of media.
