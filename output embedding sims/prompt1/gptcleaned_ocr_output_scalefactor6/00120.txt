1. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1. Other Propaganda Theorists
L. Harold Lasswell (1902-1976)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking critical analyses of it. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was oral. Lasswell was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both qualitative and quantitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda, and discovering the effects of propaganda on the audience (Rogers, 44). Lasswell is credited with creating the most common communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 156). Generally, content analyses can be defined as "the overall range of communication norms being categorized into folders to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 156). In his essay "The Structure and Function of Communication," Lasswell explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and the inadequacy of the media used. By understanding the composition of the message, Lassell also recommends undertaking the "chain of influence that takes place from one source to one conclusion and from one content to another audience" (p. 74).

This method of correlation has led strongly to Lasswell's definition of communication, which stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 89). Lasswell also offered the definition of media which "organized activity in which people pursue strategic goals" (p. 89). Both definitions were at the core of his work within the area of propaganda.

Lasswell believed acedia, specifically the mistake of limited and also appearing unwilling to accept it. However, the confrontation of these conditions within the democratic system, and its being presented as temporary agreement. This can be an alternative way of viewing the preservation of an individual's autonomy that is similar to Hegerelian dialectics. 

2. Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were focusing on public opinion and propaganda, Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was a leading public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays believed in creating a diverse of communication channels to influence the minds of the public to accept ideas, buy products, or adopt behaviors. In other propaganda theories, Bernays argued that they can be more effective when they appeal to the innermost desires of individuals, rather than using any rational argument. Bernays states, "All men are kept keen and on the move by constant pressure to buy, largely by their desire to keep up with the Joneses or to be the first on their block to wear a particular item or use it in a certain way," (p. 66).

Can anyone deny that the public space can be shaped, and that other propaganda can be more subtle yet just as dominating in the field of public relations? "Public relations is the art of adapting private interests to public opinion, by understanding, estheticism, morality, or religion" (Bernays, 195). One popular notion that the public space can be affected in this way is through the influence of public relations, "Public relations are a career path, by interaction, for catering to the needs of every public, community, special interest group, or tribe" (Bernays, 195).

Bernays and other theorists suggest that emotions from the public can be controlled through the manipulation of public relations, "Pay all other honors to the gods in society, gathering knowledge and facts, rationalizing propaganda, and utilizing persuasion to educate the public opinion in their specialized directions, so they can be used for the greater public good" (Bernays, 195).
