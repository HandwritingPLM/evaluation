Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1908. During the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, he worked on some family planning communications. The book has become a standard textbook on diffusion theory and interest a wide intellectual audience with applications of diffusion theory in such fields as journalism, sociology, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2004 due to failing kidney disease. He passed away on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1908), diffusion refers to the process by which an innovation spreads through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation can be an idea, practice, or object perceived as new by an individual or another unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels. People can get information of an innovation and perceive its value by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass communication.

Rogers (1985) presented a well-received model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-O-R-E (Source, Message, Channel, Receiver, Effect). Specifically, sender can be inventors or opinion leaders, message can be a new idea or product, channels can be mass communication, receivers can be members of a social system, and the effects can be an individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, the variable of time is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1985), the variables involved in the diffusion include the innovation-decision process; innovativeness; an innovation's rate of adoption. Different factors have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion theory has been applied to various fields such as economic development and personal influences on important consumer decisions, in order to predict the rate at which new ideas and technologies spread through society.
