EL. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1) Other Propaganda Theorists.
Lasswell (1902-1976)

Lasswell was a propaganda writer. Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself.

Harold Lasswell (1902-1976) was a pioneer scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both quantitative and qualitative analysis of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda, and discovering the effects of propaganda on the target audience. Lasswell is credited with creating The Media Communication Procedure of Content Analysis. Generally, content analysis can be defined as "the investigation of communication messages by counting various defined message components as an indicator in order to measure content variables." Known as "Centers of Communication," Lasswell explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell aims to achieve the goal of understanding the "areas of influence this media can have on issues in society and where it comes into conflict."

This method of content analysis tied strongly to Lasswell's definitional communication theory, which states, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effect." Lasswell was concerned with how content shapes public opinion. He particularly focused on understanding the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democracy. In this vein, Lasswell had a skepticism towards the power of the media in shaping public opinion. However, he still saw the media as affecting the decisions within the democratic system and as being influenced by government. This can be seen as differing views from the perspective of the public as being pervasive due to Lippmann's thought.

Approximately at the same time, Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public influence of propaganda. Douglas Berelson (1959) was examining propaganda, propaganda shapes, and public opinion. Berelson focused on the elements of content shapes seen in media like newspapers, radio, or people. Berelson recognizes the role of public judgment in understanding propaganda. He writes, "We are preoccupied, conditioned by, and indoctrinated by what we read see, how we receive information, and how we are more members of media or groups in the manner they are cohesively functioning and influencing each other.‚Äù Therefore, on the idea that public opinion can be swayed, it has its ability to sway public opinion, Berelson posits and believes.

By understanding the propaganda frenzy, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda communicated messages to the public. Lasswell was particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion democratically. However, it was noticed that the public has a role and responsibility in determining what to think, functioning as a bolt.

Berelson writes, "We are preoccupied and condition our choice, and this is largely been seen as we have remained." Indeed, how honest [to] genuinely and cope together is a change that has not yet been fully explained in a globally democratizing outlook yet a significant-led tendency for companies to affect public persuasion within the public arena remains. This perspective holds true as a view of public persuasion.

Through researching key companies in public relations companies, Mary L. Luke found the consensus of the public wanting a well-attuned balance when companies blend their shrewd ways undeniably effective persuasion by keeping the public in mind, one...
