Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories.

The themes developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Grunig, and Bernays are important for our understanding of the processes of persuasion. Based on the ideas of their predecessors, communication and theory have been of significant value in the influence and effect of the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has been essential in researching and understanding the impact of the media on the public. Through the contributions of Eysenck and Kinder, Titz, Defleur, and Most and Shaw, a comprehensive understanding of the ways has been developed. The field can now be categorized into functions such as agenda-setting, framing, and priming, and their effects on the public. The theories presented in this paper are closely related to show the direct effects and united efforts resulting from research. These effects are intended to act alongside each other, achieving direct effects on individuals, where propagandists could directly influence the thoughts of individuals. Indeed, theorists like Lippmann suggest that the message can be altered through both thought and influence people's thoughts about various issues. This line of thinking resulted in an interesting point for further research in the realm of the effects of the media. Such ideas were challenged through the work of Grunig and Kinders, as well as Meeks and Shaw. Overall, the research discussed in this paper has been very important for understanding the media, the manipulation of the public, and the doctrine of public opinion. While the views of persons like Lasswell, Lerner, and Ellul were created in the past, they still hold significance today.
