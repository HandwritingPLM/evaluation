Defining Uncertainty

Research conducted under the tele of interpersonal communication initially focused on parent, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of beaming, dissonance, and social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2006). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of Social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Hovland, Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control, thus was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson. Fees (2005) state: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research field during the past few decades.”

"Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its inception in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to acknowledge those pioneers who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is central to our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Uncertainty, when it has been studied, has been identified as an important construct necessary for the study of communication. It took on a mathematical approach and here it has been defined as a philosophical manner of considering social reality. It aligns the theoretical framework of information theory and offers an insightful way of examining the nature of uncertainty. Researcher Shannon and Weaver (1949) related this view of uncertainty with the transmission of messages, but their work drew insights from the work of Weiss and Lallas (1975).

In their work, Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts proposed by Heider (1958) in attribution research. Here, uncertainty is conceptualized as the “number of alternative ways individuals might act or interpret a situation.” According to Berger and Calabrese, uncertainty can be defined as the “degree of certainty that individuals have less predictable and past behaviors.” During interactions, individuals are constantly processing information to reduce uncertainty. However, Green and Tarulli (2001) stated: “uncertainty is also contributing to the developing of the relationships”
