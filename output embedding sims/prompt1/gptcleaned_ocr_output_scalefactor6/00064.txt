1. Return to Germany

Published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested this way that could jeopardize their return to Germany. As the fate of the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, Adorno opened in its new premises in 1801. Horkheimer became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954, Adorno published an essay entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay, Adorno warned how industrialization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed of psychological control (Adorno, 1956, p. 153). They were one of the few academics in the 1950s that Adorno was interested in the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it strange that the leading cultural theorist of the day did not participate in cultural developments of the fifties (Jaeger, 1969, p. 101). Adorno would sometimes unconsciously attempt to reshape his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture in the United States (Adorno, 1980, p. 20), and gave a lecture in Germany in 1960 on The Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1956, while revisiting the essay Transparencies on Film, Adorno conceded that filmmaking might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the boundaries of academia (Hohendahl, 1980, p. 184).

2. One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse argued for an analysis of late capitalist society in a systematically cohesive, as opposed to other writers of the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1995, p. 60). Instead of countercultural ecological ethics, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society was in the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Feenberg, 2007, p. 144). Capitalist reduction and the vast wealth that resulted from it created a system of repressive tolerance that the societal elements suppressed and made passive (Althusser, 2005, p. 85). The whole of society had become organized around an ideology where its main objectives were inhuman social control and manipulation. Critiquing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the individual of mass media could be distinguished from their manipulation and induced satisfaction (Marcuse, 1964, p. 8). Moreover, it is difficult to balance arguments in separating Spheres Of Ideology from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture as personal marks or entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in his analysis. Adorno had determined that the divided aspects of society allowed for multiple contradictions to emerge. Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individuals be made their own agents if the apparatuses of stereotyped reproduction and incorporative subordination be what impresses itself upon them?" (Marcuse, 1964, p. 361). At a time of doubt and questioning traditions, Marcuse developed an oppositional stance, he remained that he was a philosopher, not an activist. Like poetry, it requires much revision to receive his essay as to the People with the Fischer publishing house in 1938, onboard the Hugo.
