Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

The Uses and Gratifications approach is an influential conception of how people use media and certain media contents. The core question of SUGT is "what do people use media for?" (McQuail, 1982). This approach suggests that people's needs influence what media they choose, how they use that media, and what gratifications they receive from it. Unlike traditional perspectives that view audiences as passive receivers of information, the Uses and Gratifications approach sees audiences as active media users who choose media based on their personal needs and backgrounds. It also suggests that the media competes with other information sources to satisfy audience needs. As traditional and new media continue to provide a wide range of content, the Uses and Gratifications approach is considered an appropriate perspective for investigating why audiences choose specific media. This approach emphasizes audiences' choices in using media, their reasons for choosing certain media over others, and the gratifications they receive based on their individual needs and requirements. In a broader perspective, the Uses and Gratifications approach provides a framework for understanding how media participants seek information or content based on their needs and interests.
