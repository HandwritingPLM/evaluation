1. Defining Uncertainty

Social constructions of reality are subject to various uncertainties and probabilities. Understanding these uncertainties and probabilities is crucial for better decision-making. The concept of uncertainty can significantly impact information exchanges and decision-making processes. Here we discuss how to encounter and positively use uncertainty in daily situations.

Individuals are often faced with barriers when trying to communicate effectively. Providing a high level of certainty can be an obstacle to effective communication. Maintaining a balance between certainty and uncertainty is key to developing strong relationships and fostering creativity. Over-reliance on certainty can inhibit progress and hinder growth in interpersonal relationships and communication. It is important to find a balance that allows for growth while still maintaining security.
