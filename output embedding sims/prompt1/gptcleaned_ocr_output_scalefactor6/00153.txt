According to Rogers' diffusion of innovations theory (1962), diffusion refers to the spread of innovation through certain channels over time. An innovation is a new idea, practice, or object perceived as new by individuals or groups. Rogers identified five different types of adopters in the diffusion process: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. Rogers defined this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40%). Figure 1 shows the relationships between types of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve.
