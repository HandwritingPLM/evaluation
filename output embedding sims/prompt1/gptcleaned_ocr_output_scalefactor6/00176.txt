Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. According to Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation by speaking actors. The former is called "langue" and the latter "parole." Langue is the systematic set of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signal that composes it, while speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure itself, langue, is the social convention or value shared throughout a society that is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

Language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract that one must accept entirely if one wishes to communicate. This is because language is a system of contractual values that resists modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and a system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language to express his personal thoughts. This is because speech is a combinative activity that corresponds to an individual act and not to pure creation.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning that is expressed through the form called the signifier, the external part of language. For example, both the words "dog" in English and in Korean are the forms expressing the actual animal, dog. The correspondence of the conceptual meaning in the external form is not in the designated relation but rather in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference between the signifier that operates the signifying system. Saussure argued that language does not reflect an efficient and actual reality of independent objects but conveys meaning through a series of conceptual and phonic differences.

Meaning is created through a process of selection and combination of signs along the associative (e.g., a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system. As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigms are a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities of selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For example, within the syntagmatic and the paradigms, we see that signs are operated on when they are related to each other.

Saussure's argument is that every sign is paired like a double and is a part of a larger whole symbolizing culture and meaning. These signs are then combined to produce meaning through the cultural conventions of that specific society.
