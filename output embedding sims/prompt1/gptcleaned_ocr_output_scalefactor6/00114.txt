Satons approach emphasizes motives and the see peched need al audience members. Blumberg and Katz (1974) commented that different people can interpret the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many demands for using the media as there are media uses (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's ideas about what they can get from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications for using the media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1977) proposed a model of "media-gratified interactions" to classify four general media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine and stress, emotional peace; (2) Personal relationships: companionship, social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference, reality exploration, value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance: for information-seeking.

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (194), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: Dogmatic versus affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotion stability of "growth" and "preservation" when charted. These factors lead to different types of needs which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1 shows a structuring of 16 general categories of human motives (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1972) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the media and categorized them in the following 5:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and self-awareness.
2. Affective needs, including emotions and pleasure feelings.
3. Personal integrative needs, including esteem, status, and role.
4. Social integrative needs, involving interaction with family and friends.
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Conclusively, McGuire's classification of the following Gratifications for media use:

- Finding out about relevant events and needs in immediate surroundings, society and the world.
- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinions and decision choices.
- Satisfying curiosity among personal spheres.
- Learning: self-education.
- Gaining a sense of security through knowledge.
- Finding reinforcement for personal values.
- Finding models of behavior in the media.
- Identifying with valued characters.
- Gaining insight into oneself.
