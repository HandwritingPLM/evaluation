l. Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication:

The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (193).

1.10 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the leaders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduating, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1942 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (San√©jacen, 20K). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin's theories, which were highly influential on the field of interpersonal communication and on the development of COT.

Lewin's theories laid the groundwork for the emerging field of cognitive dissonance theory (CDT), which attempted to explain how imbalances among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT in his observations that people seek to reduce inconsistencies in their beliefs and attitudes.

Cognitive dissonance theory posits that individuals seek to reduce inconsistency and anxiety about their beliefs by aligning them with each other. Thus, Festinger's legacy can still be recognized in modern social and science research. Festinger, 1980, stated, "It was in this era that Leon Festinger developed and tested his theory."

2. Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider was a pioneer in the field of social psychology, known for his work on attribution theory. He influenced Lewin's social psychology research and expanded on fundamental concepts of social perception and balance theory. 

Heider's work in the United States and Europe led to significant advancements in understanding interpersonal communication and social dynamics.
