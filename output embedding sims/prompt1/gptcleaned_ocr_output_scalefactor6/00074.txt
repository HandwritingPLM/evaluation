Other Propaganda Theoret:

1. Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

While Lippmann was writing about propaganda, Harold Lasswell was conducting in-depth analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 1554).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both qualitative and quantitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the core essence of propaganda, and discovering the effects of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 14). Lasswell is credited with creating the method of communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 14). Generally, content analysis can be defined as, "the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classes in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 244). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication," Lasswell (1946) explains that content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols may persuade the audience's opinions, and the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influences that runs from content to content and from content to audience" (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is closely tied to Lasswell's (1930) early definition of communication which states, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effect" (p. 58). Content analysis was mainly the focus of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the concept of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this way, Lasswell has created a cycle whereby the public is trained in the information that is presented to them and also apprehensive to accept it. However, there is still information that is influencing their decisions within the democratic system, and it is being presented to them by the government. This bears an interesting similarity to Lippmann's theories.

2. Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda, Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1952) defines propaganda as "a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a public to an enterprise, idea, or group" (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bernays recognizes that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning as a whole. Bernays states, "We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of... Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society" (p. 3).

Building on these ideas that public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part of society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of public relations. "Public relations is the attempt, by information, persuasion, and adjustment, to engineer public support for an activity, cause, movement, or institution" (Bernays, 1955, p. 3). In the book Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) lays out the framework for understanding the public and developing a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relations campaign is the adjustment of the campaign to the attitudes of various groups in society, gathering information to effectively express an idea, and finally, utilizing persuasion to influence public opinion in the desired direction.

These perspectives represent a step forward for mass communication theory. They move away from more typical presentations of "unornamented propaganda" and move towards a deeper understanding.
