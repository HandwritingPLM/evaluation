Uses and Gratifications

Introduction

The uses and gratifications approach is an influential tract in media research. The original conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of Can Mad Conk. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1983). There is a basic idea in this approach: audiences know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.

In the mass communication process, the uses and gratifications approach puts the function of linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use certain media, and what gratifications the media provide them. This approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users who are dependent on what media do for them and assume audiences are heterogeneous, uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with what people do with media (Katz, Bl 1973). Mainly, audiences perceive media and respond to the media, which is determined by their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates that the media competes with other information sources for audiences' need satisfaction and attention. As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide a vast range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different media. This approach emphasizes audiences' choice by assessing their reasons for using media and the various gratifications obtained through use based on individual social and psychological requirements. A broader perspective from communication theory provides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants select information and content selectively, in line with their needs and interests. Audience members then incorporate the content into their own messages.

It is accepted that communication theories have developed through the works of various disciplines and scholars over the past 10 years. With more unified fields in these disciplines, researchers can gain higher conceptions of understanding media.
