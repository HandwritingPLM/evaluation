i. Needs and Gratifications

Research has established that people have different needs and gratify them through various media. Each individual's background, such as education, influences what they seek from media and how they interpret it in relation to their needs. Audience members are more aware of and can satisfy their needs for entertainment, companionship, emotional release, exploration, and cultural reinforcement. Blumler and Katz (1974) proposed a model that includes cognitive needs, affective needs, personal integrative needs, social integrative needs, and tension release needs. Additionally, McQuail (1974) identified different types of needs: cognitive, affective, personal integrative, social integrative, and tension relief needs. Medoff's (1983) classification of reasons for media use includes staying informed, seeking advice, satisfying curiosity, learning, feeling secure, finding validation, modeling behavior, interacting with others through media, and escaping reality.
