Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception, the essay examines the chronological developments. Three pre-conditions, though its generation, and its widespread reception. The idea of the culture industry grew out of a discourse with culture, developed through insights into the mechanical reproduction of culture, and is ultimately formed in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Stalinism. All this led to a tense setting.

The present material discusses the genesis of the discourse on the culture industry as rooted in the conflict of ideas between Adorno and Walter Benjamin in 1933. Benjamin considered Adorno as his disciple, though their dispute left Adorno as the last authority on culture thought after Benjamin's death. Despite this, Adorno lost his niche in academia during the rise of the Nazi party, making him somewhat of a nomad in Europe. Adorno's direct involvement in the operation of the Frankfurt School not only restricted autonomy but also affected philosophical thought.

Adorno clashed with his contemporaries due to different theoretical perspectives in critical theory, where Stalinist repression and commodification of mass culture in the United States played crucial roles. Adorno's work resonated with Benjamin's ideas concerning culture and aesthetics, sporadically leading to intellectual dispute. Adorno explored culture not as an abstract concept but as a material practice that intensified and contradicted existing sociopolitical hierarchies.
