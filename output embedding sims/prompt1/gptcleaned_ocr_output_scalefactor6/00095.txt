Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1 Harold Lasswell (1907-1975)

Harold Lasswell, often credited as the founder of propaganda analysis, was utilizing a concept known as ACP - who Says What in Which Channel to Whom With What Effect. Much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Walter Lippmann himself.

1.2 Jacques Ellul (1912-1994) was a French philosopher and sociologist who focused on understanding the mechanisms of propaganda.

Ellul can be credited with creating an analysis that examined the effects of media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. He believed that the public is limited in the information presented to them and apprehensive to accept it, leading to a restricted system within democratic societies.

Herbert Gerth (1920-1995) was another key figure in the study of propaganda. He recognized that propaganda can be both heretical or beneficial to the public, shaping their ideas and perceptions.

Based on these theories, it is essential to critically analyze the sources of information and the methods used to influence public opinion. By understanding these mechanisms, we can decipher the intentions behind propaganda and its impact on society.
