i. Needs and Gratifications

The uses and gratifications approach emphasized how an individual's need for particular media content could vary based on their background or experiences. Different people use the media for different purposes, and the same media content can be perceived differently by individuals. This variation in perception is one way that people interact with the media as individuals have different needs, interests, social background, and experiences which shape their expectations of the media content they consume. Audience members are aware of and can articulate their needs, using different media content to fulfill those needs. Blumler, Katz, and Gurevitch [1972] proposed a model of "uses and gratifications" which identifies four important media gratifications: (1) diversion or escapism from routine problems; (2) personal relationships and companionship; (3) personal identity and social integration; and (4) surveillance for information needs. McQuail [1974] distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective, and added three dimensions: active versus passive use, goal orientation, and permanence in terms of gratification. These factors result in 16 different types of motivations for media use (see Figure 1). Additionally, McGuire, Gurevitch, and Haas [1973] identified 25 needs related to social and psychological aspects of human behavior, which can be categorized into cognitive needs (acquiring information), affective needs (emotions and feelings), personal integrative needs (self-esteem, identity, etc.), social integrative needs (interaction with others), and tension release needs (escaping reality). 

Furthermore, McQuail (1963) classified common reasons for media use as:

- Finding out about current events and conditions in the immediate surroundings, society, and the world
- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision-making
- Satisfying curiosity and general interest
- Learning for self-education
- Aiming for feelings of security through entertainment
- Finding reinforcement of personal values
- Finding models of behavior
- Hanging out with valued others in the media
- Passing time during idle periods.
