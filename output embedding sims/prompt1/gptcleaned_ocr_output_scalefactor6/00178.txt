Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition of media research. The original conception of the approach was based on the search for explaining the great appeal of certain media contents. The core question of each research was: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1952) There exists a basic idea in this approach beyond concrete content, namely which media they select to meet their needs.

It suggests that people determine the media they consume based on certain needs and what gratifications the specific media offer. It challenges traditional perspectives in that it regards audiences as active participants rather than passive consumers of information. In contrast to traditional media research that asks “what media do people use” and assumes audiences are homogenous, uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with “what people do with media” (Katz, 1959). It also assumes that personal characteristics influence media use and responses due to individual differences and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates that some people are more media content to satisfy problems with media platforms and content and consider public perspectives on how to empower audiences in different perspectives and evaluate their motivations for using media. The view also gained popularity due to studies that relate different media genres and categories to personal needs and desires.

It poses the idea that audiences are not passive recipients of media content but are rather active in determining their own media consumption patterns and gratifications from media.
