Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics.

The system operates on two levels, the systematic system and variation, scaled langua and the later speech. Langue is the systematized set of the material of the signal which compose individual parts of language" (Barthes, 1967).

The social dimension. The structural level, langue, is the social convention or value shared throughout a society that is stabilized and standardized. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from it.

To Saussure, the linguistic system is created by speaking actors. The former are conventions necessary for communication, indifferent.

It is opposed to it speech (parole) and covers the purely. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system well.

On the contrary, parole is feasible because it is obtained convention, the act.

A language is therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language; it is essentially a collective contract that one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thoughts. It is because speech is essentially a combinatorial activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not a purely creative.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts. The signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning that is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Hence, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "I propose to retain the word sign (signe) to designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (agnifie) and signifier (significant); the last mentioned terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1909).

The correspondence of concept/meaning to the external form is not in the designated explanation, but rather in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1950) argues that language does not reflect a pre-existent and objective reality of independent objects but constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences. According to Saussure, "meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system" (Barker, 2010, p. 28). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sequence, and the paradigmatic meter. A field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another, despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the same idea, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, let us consider the following sentence: "I went to a theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is established through the three combination of sign. The signs within the sequence, such as theater, my, and girlfriend can be substituted for any other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She went to a restaurant with her mother." Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when they are related to each other. Fundamentally, signs do not make sense by virtue of reference to entities in an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each other. Thus, meaning is understood as a collective convention organized through the relation between signs. We are central to Saussure's argument that each word is meaningful in relation to the difference between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence that generates meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a specific context.
