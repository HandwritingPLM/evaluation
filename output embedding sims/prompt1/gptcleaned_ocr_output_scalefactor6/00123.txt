1. WEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Needs and Gratifications

Needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the perceived needs of audience members. Blumer and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content can gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Murder & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual’s background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people’s ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet those needs. That is, audience members are diverse and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumer, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivision of the larger area of motivation was developed by Peltoage (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of “affective cognitive and needs”. Then he added three dimensions: achievement versus passive initiation, external compared to "internal goal orientation, and emotion stability versus growth and preservation. These factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to the structure of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Goetz's (1973) developed 35 items taken from the social and psychological functions of the media and grouped them into five categories:

A. Strategic/Educative needs, including information, orientation, understanding, and learning.
B. Personal/Recreational needs, including diversion, pleasure, relaxation, and leisure time.
C. Social/Integrative needs, including credibility, social interaction, and social utility.
D. Escapist needs, such as security and escapism.
E. Entertainment needs, including aesthetics and humor.
