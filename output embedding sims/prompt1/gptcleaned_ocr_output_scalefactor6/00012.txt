Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics.
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the first: langue and the second: parole.
Langue, as the first level, represents the characteristics and conventions necessary for communication, regardless of the material of the signal.
In contrast, parole, which is the second level, represents the actual expression of the individual's speech.
Barthes integrates Saussure's linguistic system within a social dimension, where langue is the social convention of shared values in society.
Language is thus, a social institution and a system of values that is the personal part of language.
It is a collection of conventions necessary for communication because language is a system of mutually agreed-upon values.
In contrast, parole represents the individual's personal expression in language with the aim of expressing personal thoughts.
Saucer distinguishes the two elements of language as parole and langue, respectively.
