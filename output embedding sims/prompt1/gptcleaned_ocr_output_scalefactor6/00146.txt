Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential paradigm in media research. The original concept of the approach was based on research for explaining the broad appeal of certain media content. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1983). There exists a basic idea in this approach: audience members seek media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs. In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of meeting need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use certain media, and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus on "what media do to people" and assume audiences are homogeneous, Uses and Gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). It allows audiences personal needs to use media and responds to their media, which is determined by their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates that the media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction. As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different.

The approach emphasizes audiences' choice by assessing their reasons for using media to the disregard of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained from the media, based on individual social and psychologically motives (McLuhan & Parker, 2007). As a broader perspective among communication researchers, it provides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants seek information or content selectively, communicate with the media, and interact (Jensen et al., 2007). Audience members are incorporated for the role they play in incorporating their needs or goals to satisfy their interests (Lowery & DeFleur, 1995).

4.2. Origin and History

It is well acknowledged that communication theories have evolved through the realms of psychology and sociology over the past 100 years, inspired by parallel ideas as well as borrowing from more disparate fields in these diverse disciplines. Researchers have crafted a series of intertwined theories of mediated communication.
