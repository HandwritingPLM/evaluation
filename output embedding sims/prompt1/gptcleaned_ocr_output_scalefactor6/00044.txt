Uncertainty Reduction

1) Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese, and Key Uncertainty Theorist

Since the twentieth century, the concept of information has been a major foundation for communication research with the development of communication theory. Information exchange and better human function in such a digital age, good and exchange of information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uncertainty Reduction Theory or URT, was established by Charles Berger and Richard Calabrese in 1972, recognizing that reducing uncertainty was a central aspect of communication. Through the development of URT, they advanced the field of interpersonal communication by focusing on this reliable foundation of uncertainty research. Vangelisti and Hoot (2000) stated, "One of the key uncertainties underpinning interpersonal interaction is the question of information with which to reduce one's doubt." The study of information is essential to all fields of communication, but it is especially critical to the understanding of uncertainty in human communication. URT places the role of communication at the center of the stage in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Boyer and Calabrese (1975) explained, "As communication researchers have engaged in studying interpersonal communication processes, they have turned to social psychological theories for insights." The research underlying the theory and framework laid by these communication theorists led to the emergence of interpersonal communication research, with the development of URT inspiring scholars to look deeper into communication theories for greater understanding and practical applications. Rooted in this emergence is the idea that interpersonal understanding can be achieved through effective communication strategies.

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field. Interpersonal communication is most often associated with relationships, conflict, and social interaction. Prior to the 1950s, only a modest amount of research was conducted under the umbrella of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant (2000) referred to this time as the inception of the field of interpersonal communication, stating, "Practically since 1901, scholars addressed communication data on the grounds that they were believed to be scientific and unbiased sources of human behavior." The 1950s period saw the development of an informal school of research on interpersonal theory and the influence of personal relationships. These theoretical paradigms were not only a response to social changes, but also a result of technological advancements and interdisciplinary collaboration that envisioned the possibility that interpersonal conflicts could be resolved through effective communication.
