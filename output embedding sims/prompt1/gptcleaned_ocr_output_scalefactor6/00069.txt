1. Needs and Gratifications

Uses and applications approach emphasizing motives and the perceived needs of audience members. Jay Blumler and Elihu Katz concluded that different people consume the same communication content for various different purposes. The mass media content may gratify different needs for different individuals.

Nevertheless, there is not only one way that people use media. Conversely, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are individuals. Basic attitudes, circumstances, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media fulfill their needs. Therefore, audience members are aware of and can state their desires for gratification when using different media. Blumler, McQuail, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to identify four important media gratifications: (1) Information stage from routine or problems; cognitive release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social interactions; (3) Personal identity: self-reflection; reality exploration; self-reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (flows of information: self-management).

As McQuail mentioned the audience's imagination was suggested by Klapper in 1960, based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "arthas" versus "oasthes" interaction, "external world" versus "internal goal orientation," and emotion stability of "prowdh and "presentation." When combined, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (see Figure 1). A synthesis of 16 general categories of users' motivation (Mitsui, 1994). Additionally, Gunewitch and Maer (1979) developed 35 needs derived from the social-psychological functions of mass media and grouped them into four categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding.

2. Affective needs, including entertainment, pleasure, and feelings.

3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, security.

4. Social integrative needs, including connecting with family and friends.

Consistently, McQuail's (1983) classification of the main common categories of gratifications sought for are:

- Finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world.
- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinions on decision choices.
- Gratifying curiosity and general interest.
- Feeling a sense of security through knowledge and help.
- Finding reinforcement for personal values.
- Finding models of behavior.
- Identifying with valued others in the media.
- Gaining insight into oneself.
