Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the public, and the perception of attention-generating propaganda is important.
Public opinion (Bernays, 1928) emphasizes the significance of carefully planning and engineering public opinions, which distinguishes modern public relations from old-age noise publicity and propaganda.
Additionally, Bernays' theories provide a different perspective on the formation of public opinion. Unlike Lippman who saw the public as easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this notion. He believes that the public is not shapeless and can't be molded at will or dictated to. Bernays points out that in attempting to influence the public, businesses must approach in a manner that is understandable and acceptable to the public.
Furthermore, Bernays elaborates on the role of Public Relations in influencing the public through openness. He emphasizes the importance of Public Relations in helping citizens understand society and evaluate the perspectives of others. While public opinion can still be shaped, it's not purely due to the public's ignorance but also through manipulation by powerful leaders.
In conclusion, the theories developed by Carnegie, Council, Lippmann, and Bernays challenge the traditional views of public influence, which remains crucial in understanding and shaping society.
