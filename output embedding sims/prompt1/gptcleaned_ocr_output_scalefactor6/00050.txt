Methodologically speaking, many of the grades of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves. Le, people

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication Should be
suspended while audience elements are explored on their own terms. (G. L317).

In addition, Katz, Shoemer, and Guretich have commented that, although past researches on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people of the media, they did not address the
connections between these predictions (Katz et al, 1974). They suggested that uses and gratifications

consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Katz et al, 1974b, p20) The studies of Boyer and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation for building the uses and gratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The careful slice of uses and
gratification is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly a new mesh foras leve emerged in
