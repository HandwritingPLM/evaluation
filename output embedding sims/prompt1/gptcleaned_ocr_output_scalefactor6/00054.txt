DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal, cognitive dissonance, social influence, and small group processes. Theories of social psychology, acceptance, and judgment, and reactance were central to shaping social interaction, relational development, and relational control. Influential pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, and Knapp played a significant role in influencing research trends on interpersonal communication over the past two decades. Today, interpersonal communication is seen as a function of developing relationships. Research on interpersonal communication focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships, emphasizing that interpersonal communication is motivated by reducing uncertainty. Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major factor contributing to the development of the field of communication. This chapter reviews the work of theorists who pioneered research on uncertainty reduction in communication, which is crucial in the development of interpersonal communication and understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty is identified as an important construct in studying communication, it is essential to know when the concept originated and how it has been defined and studied. One way to understand uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1929) proposed that uncertainty existed in a situation when there were many possible alternatives and their probabilities were relatively equal. They related uncertainty to the transmission of messages, contributing to the development of uncertainty reduction theories. Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded the concept of uncertainty in interpersonal communication by defining it as the number of alternative ways each person might behave. The higher the uncertainty in a situation, the more difficult it is to predict behaviors and occurrences. Uncertainty can hinder relational development by causing stress and anxiety, leading to lower levels of communication competence. Incompetent communicators may struggle to establish relationships or engage in initial interactions. Lower levels of uncertainty can lead to increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, intimacy, and liking. In interactions, individuals aim to enhance predictability and explain behaviors for future interactions. Where uncertainty exists, it can affect the stability and predictability of a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) argue that high uncertainty and unpredictability can weaken a relationship.
