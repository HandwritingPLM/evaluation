THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNCERTAINTY

played a considerable role in affecting relationships, said Kelley and Howland. By the 1970s, team interviews began to be documented and analyzed. This was influenced by the research at Knegp, Mehrabian, Thayer, Duck, Kelley, and Tian. During the later part of the decade and into the PGR, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Maniap, Roloff, and Berger became popular. Combined with research on adaptation by Calis and Paserkon, Berger (COO) states: “these early theoretical surveys helped shape the interpersonal communication agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Specifically, Interpersonal Communication focuses on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, and the function of developing relationships. Research in interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger and Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1950s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter aims to focus on the theories that projected the research of uncertainty reduction in Communication later. This work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and central to our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to understand when the concept originated and how it has been defined in theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty arises in a given situation when there are a high number of possible alternatives and the probabilities of their occurrence are indeterminate. Shannon and Weaver related the view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of WRT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from information theories, as well as Heldre's research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese expanded the concept of uncertainty to interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave” (p. 601). The greater the breadth of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behavior and outcomes. During interactions, individuals are not only faced with perceptions of predicting present and past behaviors but also explaining why partners behave or believe the way they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1992) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can arise from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially want." Uncertainty plays a significant role in examining relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty in communication may not be able to develop relationships or sustain them. Teenagers in initial interactions, West, and Toraer (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty lead to increased verbal and non-verbal behavior, increased levels of interaction, and increased liking. Both excessive certainty and predictability can also hinder a relationship, as stated by Heath and Errzan: “Too much certainty and predictability can deaden a relationship; Just enough certainty supports continued exploration of the other person's mind and heart.” When high uncertainty exists, it can be difficult to reach this goal. Although individuals seek less uncertainty and want predictability in relationships, too much certainty can often inhibit a relationship. Heath and Errzan's views of certainty and predictability can influence a relationship: “Too much certainty and predictability can deaden a relationship; Just enough certainty supports continued exploration of the other person's mind and heart.”
