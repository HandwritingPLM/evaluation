Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lipman, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Lipman was able to bring attention to the fact that the public can be influenced by outside forces. He focused on how the media can shape public opinion and how the public can be manipulated by these influences. Through the work of Ellul, Lewin, and Lasswell, a more comprehensive understanding of the role of the media in shaping public opinion has been developed. The public has access to various forms of media such as social media, journalism, and television, and the potential effects of these mediums on public opinion can be significant.

The theories presented in this paper are tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited specific programming that can influence the way the public thinks. Like the theories of Lipman and Lasswell, the idea that the media might be influencing public thought was groundbreaking, but it may also be influenced by what people believe. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research by scholars like Weber, McCroskey, and Shay. The research of these scholars is very important in the understanding of the media, the communication process, and the formation of public opinion. While the ideas of Lipman, Lasswell, Bernays, and others may be complex to understand, they contribute significantly to how we interpret the world around us.
