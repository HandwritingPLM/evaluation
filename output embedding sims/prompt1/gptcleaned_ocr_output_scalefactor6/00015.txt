1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach when emphasis is put (yet driven toward the individual's needs and pleasures.
Bees, Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people consume the same communication
channels for very different purposes. The same media content may fulfill different needs for different individuals. This is not only true for the type of media that people use but also for the reasons
for using the media and their varying needs.

Social contexts, social situations, and the individual's background, such as experience, interest,
education, affect people's ideas about the media through which they satisfy their
needs. That is, audience members are generally different and can articulate clear motives and gratifications
for using different media. McQuail, Blumer, and Brown (1992) proposed a model of “media gratification:
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships companionship: social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self-reference: role model; and (4) Surveillance: information; and (5) Social integration: social interaction.

Another extended version of the audience's content consumption was suggested by McGuire (1974) based
On a general theory of human behavior. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” orientation, “internal” versus
“external” locus of control, and expectation of “prevention” and “prediction.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivation which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1
Structuring of the perceptual world of consumer's motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevich and Haas
(1975) developed 25 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the media content and
put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding.

2. Affective needs, relating to emotions, feelings.

3. Personal integrative needs, focusing on one's self.

4. Social integrative needs, involving interaction with family and friends.

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Overall, McQuail's (2004) classification of the following common reasons for media use include:

- Finding out about current events and situations in immediate surroundings, society, and the
world.

- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinions and decision choices.

- Satisfying curiosity and general interest.

- Learning, education.

- Gaining a sense of security through knowledge acquisition.

- Finding reinforcement for personal values.

- Finding models of behavior.

- Identifying with valued others (in the media).

By gaining insight into these needs and motivations.
