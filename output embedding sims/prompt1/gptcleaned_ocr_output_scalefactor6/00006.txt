Chapter 1: Uncertainty Reduction

Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept and knowledge base of uncertainty theory has been a major focus of research and the development of communication theory in which individuals request, provide, and exchange informal information in social interactions. More particularly, Charles E. Berger and Richard J. Reg (1975) recognized that there was a general lack of certainty in human relationships and began examining this significant relationship with uncertainty.

This led to the development of the field of interpersonal communication. The study of information exchange has attracted research by Heath and Urbank (1983) specifically focusing on uncertainty reduction in communication. This area of research is of particular interest to communication researchers as it relates to the overall sociocultural and psychological aspects of communication, emphasizing the importance of understanding rather than theoretical approaches.

Traditionally, communication has been viewed through the lens of distinguishing types of communication behavior, often linked to social psychology studies. Heath and Brenri prior to the time observed a notable shifting perspective towards interpersonal communication primarily since the mid-19th century. Communication as the original essence became the main focus, especially with regard to human behavior influenced by relational aspects.

Communication problems were not only a result of individual issues, but also relational issues. Research trends in this field have been influenced by humanistic psychology and relational perspectives, emphasizing the importance of understanding relational dynamics as part of communication studies.
