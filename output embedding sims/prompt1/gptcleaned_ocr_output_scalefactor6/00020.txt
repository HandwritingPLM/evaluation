1. Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes that different people use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may serve different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Conversely, there are as many reasons for using media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situations, and the individual's background, such as experience, influences, and production, all affect people's views on what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their purposes and gratifications for using media. Blumler and Brown (2017) proposed a theory of “media-person interaction” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional pleasure; (2) Personal relationships: companionship, social integration; (4) Personal identity: self-enrichment, morality compliance, value reinforcement; and (2) Surveillance [forms of information-seeking].

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by Mooijman (1974), based on a Person Theory of human needs. He distinguished between two kinds of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” media, “external work” versus *internal* goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “maintenance”. When combined, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Blumler, Gunter, and Hance (1974) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the advertising and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, gaining knowledge and uncertainty reduction;
2. Affective needs, including cognition, pleasure, and feelings;
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility and subjective states;
4. Social integrative needs, including entertaining companionship and support; and
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Consequently, McQuail's (1964) classification of the televiewing common residents included the following key uses:
- Finding out about relevant events and conditions in widespread society
- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinions and making choices
- Cultivating curiosity and general interest
- Finding a sense of security through nervous relief
- Finding relief or pleasure in the consumption of literary works
- Finding a model of behavior
- Identifying with valued themes in the media
- Finding inspiration in one's life
