I NEEDS AND GRATIFICATION

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows:
They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is considered active, i.e., an important part of the media use process, and the patterns of media use are shaped by more or less definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience.
2. In the mass communication process initiating the connection between need gratification and theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and behavior.
3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs catered by the communication media build a segment of a wider range of human needs, and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption constantly varies.
4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - i.e., people are sufficiently self-aware to report their needs and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.
5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience reactions are explored on their own terms (pp. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blum, and Gurevitch also pointed out that, although previous perspectives on gratifications denoted various preconditions that affect people's media choices, they did not address the connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974). They introduced a model based on the following aspects: "(1) the social and psychological origins of (2) needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass field of other sources which lead to (5) different experiences (of engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) feed production and (7) other core effects, perhaps previously underestimated areas" (Katz et al., 1974). The study of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation for building the assessment and quantification approach. Since then, the research on this subject has been broadened and intensified. The current state of needs and gratifications is still based on Katz's initial analysis, particularly as new media have emerged in an electronic information age where people have more options for media consumption.

Needs and Gratifications
The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of media consumers. As Katz (1972) suggests, people use media for very different purposes. The same media content may satisfy different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media; on the contrary, there are as many reasons for consuming media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Personal needs, social environment, and individual background, such as age, interests, and education, influence people's choices about the media they consume and how they use media to meet their needs. Therefore, unique individuals can derive their own satisfactions and gratifications from using media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interaction" to explain media gratification.
