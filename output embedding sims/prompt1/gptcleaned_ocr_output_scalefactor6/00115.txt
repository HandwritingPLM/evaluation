Needs and Gratifications

The uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumer and Katz (1974) concluded that different audience members engage with media for very different purposes. The same media content may create different moods for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people’s ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media, behavior, Blumler, and Brown (15 12) proposed a model of “media-person interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release. (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reliance; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subfield concerning the audience's motivation was suggested by Blumler (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” indulgence, “external versus internal” goal orientation, and orientation stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1.4 structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motives (McQuail, 1972). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1979) developed 25 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and grouped them into three categories:

- Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding.
- Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings.
- Personal integrative needs, including credibility and booster.
- Social integrative needs, including bonding with family and friends.
- Tension release needs including escape or stress relief.

Katz's (1965) classification of uses followed by:

- Finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world.
- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinions and decision choices.
- Satisfying curiosity and material interests.
- Amusing and escaping.

- Maintaining a sense of security through knowledge.
- Finding a reinforcement for personal beliefs.
- Finding models of behavior.
- The valued others (in the media).
- Identifying with.

These are eight human motives.
