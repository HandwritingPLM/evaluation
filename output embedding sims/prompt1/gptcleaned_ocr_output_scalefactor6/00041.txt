Lo sees and gratifies an array of needs and desires. Based on the well-perceived understanding of varied needs that individuals have, Gaeverie and Katz (1974) concluded that different people engage in media consumption for different purposes. The desires and gratifications sought may partly depend on what interests individuals. These needs and gratifications vary among people, whether they are young, older, need entertainment, or seek information. Basic needs, social connections, and the influence of education affect people's preferences for media and their desires in life. People are aware of and can articulate their preferences and reasons for consuming different media, including entertainment, informative content, and news.

Another significant aspect of the gratification theory is supported by McQuail's approach, which highlights that individuals have distinct needs and preferences compared to previous theories. McQuail emphasized three primary motivations: informational, personal identity, and recreation needs. These motivations are essential in explaining media consumption patterns, with individuals seeking to fulfill different needs and satisfactions through their media choices. The study of peer group relations, gender roles, and individual identities also play a crucial role in shaping media preferences and consumption behaviors. Gender differences in media consumption habits are distinctly observed, with women being found to consume different media types than men. 

In conclusion, understanding people's various needs and gratifications is crucial in comprehending their media consumption behaviors. As individuals seek to fulfill different needs and desires, their media consumption patterns reflect these motivations. Further research and studies are necessary to delve deeper into these relationships between needs and gratifications to gain a comprehensive understanding of media consumption behaviors.
