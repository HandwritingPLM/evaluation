1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

The cornerstone of information theory has always been a strong foundation in interpersonal communication theory. Informed exchange is a basic human form of interaction in which individuals seek, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uncertainty reduction theory (URT), developed by Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), asserts that reducing uncertainty is a central objective of communication. Through the development of URT, scholars have advanced the field of interpersonal communication by emphasizing its significant role in uncertainty reduction, Heath and Orton (1983) state "One of the motivations underlying interpersonal communication is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty" (p. 159). The exchange of information is crucial to all modes of communication, yet in relation to the study of uncertainty in particular, an advanced theoretical approach in the field of interpersonal communication is necessary. URT plays the role of a communication bridge between central disciplines that were initially slow in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Calabrese (1975) note "When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal communication process, they have benefited by adopting the perspective that emphasizes interpersonal communication as a unique process" (p. 1). The research underlying this theory and efforts made by contemporary scholars marked the emergence of interpersonal communication research as a significant field of study. The influence of URT on communication processes has been far-reaching.

Traditionally, communication studies were considered an interdisciplinary field and research on interpersonal communication has roots in linguistics, sociology, and psychology. By the 1980s, accumulated research fell under the umbrella of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant (1983) identified a shift in the understanding of the field of interpersonal communication "Particularly noteworthy since 1980 has been the shift in research emphasis on the central theme of reducing uncertainty and the significant impact of interpersonal relationships" (p. 53). The growth attributed to the development of interpersonal research is largely due to the popularity of social psychology and the intersection of other scientific disciplines. Research focuses on human psychological problems as well as relational dynamics as a result of interactions.
