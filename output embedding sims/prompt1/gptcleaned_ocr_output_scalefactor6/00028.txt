Names of "The Original Inducers"

In a world where nobody remembers the past
She had a secret, a talent that she keeps to herself
And oh Pigs

For centuries she had lived in the shadows with her unique skill
Debt seethed afl, tied by an ancient vow to keep her magic a secret
But when fate brought him to her doorstep

There was an aura surrounding him
Deep blue eyes that seemed to see right through her

Pacing back and forth in "The Den" anxiously biting his nails, he muttered
Something quietly to himself, barely audible

Her heart beat faster as she approached him
Their eyes met and sparks flew
He opened his mouth to speak, but she shushed him quickly

"It's not safe here," she whispered in a hushed tone
But he insisted on knowing more, an eager look in his eyes

And so the story continued, unraveling bit by bit
Until they both found themselves lost in the magic of the moment

The tension between them was palpable
A quiet understanding passed between them

And as the night wore on, they knew their lives would never be the same again
Separated by circumstances beyond their control

Their destinies intertwined, bound by a powerful magic
They would face countless challenges together, but they would also find strength in each other

And as the sun rose on a new day
They knew they were meant to be together

The end of an era, a new chapter beginning
In a world full of uncertainty and danger

But as long as they had each other
They knew they could overcome anything that came their way

Together, they would forge a new path
One filled with light and hope

And as they stood side by side, facing the unknown
They knew that as long as they had each other, they could conquer anything that came their way

The legacy of their love would live on, a beacon of hope for future generations

And as the world moved on, they stood together
Ready to face whatever challenges came their way.
