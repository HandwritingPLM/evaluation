1 Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research. Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and in the development of LRT. Festinger is best known for the theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect individuals. Festinger understood CDT based on observations regarding attitudes changing in small groups. CDT allows for three relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other, a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in conflict with each other, and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another. Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of averseness and discomfort individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory posits that individuals look to feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate their own abilities, the individual seeks the opinions of others who are similar to themselves. This need for sortio can lead to seeking others' opinions in situations of uncertainty. Berger and Calabrese (1975) applied social comparison to LRT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others who are proximal when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of their behavior or opinions in a particular situation.” Festinger received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's legacy is significant, and his theoretical influence can be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aaron Bird Festinger, (1989) stated, “I was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of Cognitive Dissonance, and his pioneering work has set the stage for much of modern social psychology.”

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider was a pioneer in the field of interpersonal relations. He writes, "I pay tribute to Lewin for the illuminating influences, which have affected much of my thinking and which are still exerting influence in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work." In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Swarthmore College and later the University of Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his academic career.
