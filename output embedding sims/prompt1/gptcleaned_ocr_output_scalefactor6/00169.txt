Other Propaganda Theorists

1. Other Propaganda Theorists
1.0 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Cigman was studying propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippenann Hevald (Rogers, 1964).

Harald Lasswell (1978) was a pioneer in effectively reporting the moral tone and qualities and sources of propaganda, and characterizing the effect of propaganda on the mass world scene. The communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1964). Generally, content analysis can be defined as “the exercise of communication of real messages by categorizing text content in classes or categories in order to measure certain variables” (Rogers, 1964) in an essay entitled “Concepts of Communication.” 

Lasswell (1962) explains that a content analysis hints at the way in which certain communications appear biased happen, the direction in which the story is progressing, the science's appeal and the centrality of the symbols used. By understanding the content of other messages, Lasswell also achieves the goal of understanding the “range of influences that fly from content to content and from content to audience.”

This method of communication leads directly to Lasswell's (1952) early definitions of communication which suggest, "Who says what in which channel to whom with what effect." Content analysis was essentially the same what gate had a definition, and Lasswell did a lot of work within this area during the trend nature and his corner.

Aside from understanding communal propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell went particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion while also understanding the effects of the media in creating public opinion. Lasswell created a cycle whereby the public is linked to the information that is presented to them, and also appropriately interpreted. However, Lasswell warns that information that is offered to their decisions within the domain shapes them, and they are influenced by the power of the media.

2. Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda, Edward Bernays was influencing public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928) defines propaganda as, “a concerted, organized effort to inform or influence the opinions on the attitudes of the community regarding some matter of common interest or concern, whether political, economic, or social” (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bernays thought that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think about or alter the opinions of individuals but this may actually be beneficial to society as a whole. Bernays writes, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes are formed, our ideas are suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This unseen form of influence” 

Based on their idea that public opinion can be influenced, and that shaping opinions is a necessary part of society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of public relations. “Public relations activities, by information, persuasion, and adjustment, operate to integrate the citizen, the enterprise, and, operating to achieve sustained prosperity, the public” 

Approaching the question of understanding the public and developing a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to successful public relations campaign is the adjustment of the campaign to the attitudes of various groups in society, gathering information to effectively express an idea, and finally, willing participants to influence the public opinions in the desired direction.

Bernays' work was a step forward for mass communication theory. They moved away from many typical perceptions of “propaganda” and generated a clear.
