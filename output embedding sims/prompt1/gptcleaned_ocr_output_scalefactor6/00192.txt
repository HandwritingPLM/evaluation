1.00 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduating, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1944 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of UBT. Festinger is best known for his theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to explain how an imbalance between cognitions might affect one's perceived reality. Festinger built on Lewin's observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1957). CDT allows for three relationships with each other, a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other, and irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect. CDT provides insights into the effects of uncertainty on interpersonal relationships and the strategies that individuals seek to reduce it. Social Comparison theory suggests that individuals compare themselves to others who are similar in the relevant dimension and this can result in conformity pressures (Tidwell & Faulk, 2004). Berger and Calabrese build on Festinger's theory by stating that "Festinger provides a potential explanation of people's experiences with uncertainty" (as cited in CITE). Festinger received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution award from the American Psychological Association in 1971 for his theoretical innovation.

Hania completed her doctorate psychology at Hinton Rowan Jitxx University in 1928. He exerted a significant influence on much of my thinking, which is evident in several ideas and concepts that derive directly from his work (Hees, 2002).
