1. CRITICAL RESPONSE TO "THE CULTURE INDUSTRY"

months later (JÃ¤ger, 2004, pp. 207-08).

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since, there have been numerous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about "the commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 173). For the generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1995, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, believing that "capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification" (Eagleton, 1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that "the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs among oppressed parties in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the system as a whole" (Eagleton, 1991, p. 75). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno's idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful conceptual apparatus between 1920 and 1970, but trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl, 1985, pp. 146-48). Thus, for some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.

Though for some critics modernist works would be seen as less relevant in the contemporary era, as noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may case where the culture industry co-opts modernist works for its own ends. The culture industry, in theory since its appearance in the 1940s, has had an importance in critical theory, resulting in fraught messages concerning concerns about the impact of the culture industry. It has not systematically explored how the culture industry operates or even dismissed the idea of a culture industry. Nevertheless, the concept introduced by Adorno is increasingly relevant in the current era as there are greater restrictions on how stations operate. As a result, attention is very much related to both radio and film, as they share similarities with the culture industry. While there is a democratizing aspect to the Internet, it appears that large commercial companies operating control many functions. Modern critics question the dominance of companies such as Google or Yahoo in the culture industry. The study of the culture industry may be necessary in order to theorize how mass communication media propagate dominant ideologies.

He complained to the dean about the radical students in his classes who were making teaching impossible. In the winter term of 1968-69, students occupied a number of buildings at the University at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research. After the strike ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, including one "tasteless demonstration" in which three females bared their breasts. Adorno died a few
