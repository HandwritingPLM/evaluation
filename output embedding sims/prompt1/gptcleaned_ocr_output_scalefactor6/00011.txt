At the beginning of the seventeenth century, engineers began to recognize the importance of planning (Crane, 1668, p. 22). Cameron (1686) similarly emphasized the significance of planning in enhancing the engineering components. He underscored that careful planning is more valuable than anything when it comes to engineering (Steel, 1956, p. 22). Patton (Berry, 1963, p. 66) further elaborates on the importance of public opinion. In order to effectively operate, a partnership between the public and businesses can yield mutually beneficial outcomes. It's essential to establish terms that are beneficial to both parties in order to achieve the desired objectives and ensure cooperation (pp. 68).

Bernay (1903) argued that it is crucial to engage the public through propaganda to shape public perception and promote mutual understanding. Bernay believed that public relations were crucial as they helped individuals comprehend the complexities of modern society, validating the viewpoints of others and fostering meaningful interactions that benefit everyone involved. According to Bernay, the public could possibly be enlightened through proper communication, educating them on essential societal issues (p. 9).

In conclusion, the theories advanced by Cameron, Louise, and Bernay hold immense significance. Building on the work of their predecessors, contemporary thinkers can draw upon these theories to navigate the challenges and complexities of today's society. By embracing the ideas of Lippe and his contemporaries, researchers can deepen their understanding of public perception and engagement. Through the research conducted by engineers such as Wenger and Steele, a deeper appreciation for the nuances of communication in public relations can be achieved. It is essential to acknowledge the impact of these theories as they continue to shape and influence society in profound ways.
