Defining Uncertainty

Research conducted under the umbrella of interpersonal communication initially focused on social influence, and small group practices. Theories explored the role of fear, performance, social judgment, and acceptance (Berger, 75). Kurt Lewin, a pioneer of social psychology, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such greats like Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of and into the LSB, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Panalp, Relot!, and Berger, along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Gales, Hutagaon, and Panarsoe. Berger (2006) states "these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal COM  agenda during the past three decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication has a focus on dyadic communication, Communication involving face-to-face interaction, and CONVICT 25 3 function of developing relationships. Research into Interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been felt interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1575).
Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to all areas of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (15 proceeded that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there were a high amount of possible alternatives and the probabilities of their occurrence were relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of Uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Colehorse (2975) adapted concepts from the information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese expanded the concept of uncertainty to interpersonal communication by defining it as "the number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" i.e.
The greater the uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and consequences. During interaction, individuals are faced with, not only with problems of predicting present and past behaviors but also explaining why partners behave or believe that they are. Berger and Bradac's (14334) definition of uncertainty highlighted this point when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of interpretations that a stranger can believe of potentially many ways." Uncertainty plays a role in the establishment and maintenance of relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit social ties when examining areas of uncertainty which combine to four categories of communication outcomes reminiscing.
