1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the label of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, shock, and reactance (Berger, 2008). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a significant role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Newinger, Hilder, Beiley, and Howie. By the 1970s, research interests began shifting into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of scholars such as Knapp, Mehcabian, Alisa, Taylor, Deck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Flanagin, Holtz, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burpeesn, and Patterson. Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past two decades” (p. 406). Today, interpersonal communication found in face-to-face communication comprises interactions of communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been acknowledged that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter aims to focus on those theorists who pioneered the presence of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is central to our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important concept necessary for the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concern originated, and how it has been defined and studied. The way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty occurs in a given situation when there was a high demand for possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver focused on the importance of uncertainty in the communication of messages, which contributed to the development of information theory. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from navigation theories as well as Heider (1948) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975) addressed the concept of uncertainty in interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the “number of alternative ways in which each interaction might behave” (p. 10). The greater the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences, creating an environment where individuals are faced with problems of predicting present and future events, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac's (1992) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say.” Uncertainty plays a significant role when entering new situations. High levels of uncertainty can adversely impact places and people. Uncertainty can create barriers to communication comprehension. Competent communicators may be able to develop relationships, while others may struggle and engage in unpredictable or random behavior. West and Farmer (2002) note that lower levels of uncertainty lead to more neutral and predictable behavior, increased levels of likability, and increased liking. The lower the uncertainty, the more likely it will lead to a positive outcome in future interactions. When high uncertainty exists, it can cause tension and limit the flow of communication. Although individuals seek balance between the levels of certainty and predictability, too much certainty and predictability can hinder collaboration. Heath and Bryant (2002) state: “Too much certainty and predictability can deaden a collaboration.”
