Early Influences

Leon Festinger

Leon Festinger was a key figure in the development of social psychology. He was influenced by the work of Kurt Lewin, who was a pioneer in group dynamics and interpersonal communication. Festinger's research followed Lewin's theories and focused on the development of cognitive dissonance theory.

Fritz Heider

Fritz Heider, a contemporary of Festinger, also made significant contributions to social psychology. Heider recognized the importance of social influence and how cognitive dissonance can impact individual behavior. His work paved the way for further research in the field.

Overall, Festinger and Heider were instrumental in shaping the early development of social psychology and their contributions continue to influence the field today.
