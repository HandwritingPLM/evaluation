1. Other Propaganda Theorists
L.A Hare Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing about propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was analyzing was actually being written by Lippmann. Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the components of propaganda, and investigating the effects of propaganda on the mass audience. Lasswell is credited with conceptualizing "The mass communication process of dominant elites". Generally, content analysis can be defined as "the investigation of communication content by categorizing responses into certain classes or categories". In one article titled "Communication of Ideas through", Lasswell (1952) outlined the four chief areas one should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a text, the direction in which the symbols point the receiver and the rarity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1952) achieves the goal of understanding the "sources of influence that result from communicated ideas combined with elements of form and appeal to audience".

Three of core areas studied strongly by Lasswell (1952) early define communication which used, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effect dp Al. Content analysis had been one of his preferences, and Lasswell continued to work within this area during his tenure and his career.

apsta in creating public opinion within a
free and rational public. He certainly faced the reservations that people may not accept his hypotheses, or that they may be swayed by the power of those who had interpreted them differently since the time of Lippmann.

Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

An approach that served as the basis for Public Relations Theory (PRT) is what Edward Bernays (1891-1995) set out to achieve. Focused on the desires, prejudices, aspirations, and ideals of people, the aim is to engineer public opinion in such a way as to be beneficial in any professional or social endeavor. Though one could argue that the public may not always be receptive to new ideas, Bernays asserted that with proper time and effort, it is possible to shape the way people think. He suggested techniques such as gathering and presenting credible facts, as well as utilizing public opinion to influence decision-making. These techniques are necessary in shaping public opinion. They are essential tools in the hands of those who wish to guide societal development towards wiser, more efficient decisions.
