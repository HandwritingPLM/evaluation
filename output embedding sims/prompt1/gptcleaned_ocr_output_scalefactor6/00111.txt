Chapter 11: Uncertainty Reduction

Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabresc and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of uncertainty has been a cornerstone for communication research and the development of communication theory. Interpersonal communication, which involves individuals requesting, providing, predicting, and exchanging information with the goal of reducing uncertainty, has been extensively studied. Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT), credited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of human communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars have greatly influenced the field of interpersonal communication by shedding light on the inherent uncertainty in communication interactions. According to Berger and Calabrese (1975), "the very fabrics of social life consist of the machineries of interaction with which we reduce uncertainty" (p. 93). The study of communication is evolving into a realm of complexity, but its relationship to the study of uncertainty is particularly advanced theoretically.

In the field of interpersonal communication, URT places the act of communication at its core, from which two key aspects in the development of the field emerge. Hennner and Calabrese (1975) asserted that when scholars combine theoretical and practical knowledge in interpersonal relationships, they gain a better understanding of the intricacies of interpersonal communication. They emphasized the importance of grounding interpersonal communication research in solid psychological theories. Referring to these as "parting points," they highlighted the significance of theoretical frameworks in guiding communication research in the discipline.

The history of interpersonal communication research is a brief overview of its trajectory. Traditionally, communication has been viewed as a multifaceted and intricate discipline that combines various perspectives to study human interaction. Heath and Hees (2000) traced the origins of the field of intercultural communication to a series of seminal moments that challenged established norms in the field of communication. Through diligent research that unraveled the complexities of interpersonal interaction, scholars like Ekeh and Ranch (2008) began to understand the nuances of perception and the role of individual differences in communication. They recognized the mutual significance of cultural predispositions, leading to a reevaluation of relational dynamics and the potential enhancement of communication effectiveness within intercultural relationships.
