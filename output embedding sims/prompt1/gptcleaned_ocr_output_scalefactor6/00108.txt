Like many other eminent scholars, Gores was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. The Saussurean mechanism of differentiation between langue and parole is crucial for communication, as it signifies the social direction of linguistic expression. Saussure juxtaposes langue, which represents a shared system of language, with parole, which is the actual expression of the individual. Language is viewed as a social phenomenon, embodying values and functioning as a social portal.

Communicating based on a defined language system implies a contractual agreement that mediates the meanings conveyed. Saussure emphasizes the vital role of the signifier and the signified in constructing meaning and determining linguistic distinctions. In his perspective, language is a collective construction embodying a system of symbols that carry meaning through a combination of concepts and sound-image associations.

Saussure argues that signs do not reflect an external reality but are produced through a process of selecting and combining various signifiers within a system. Meaning emerges from this interplay of signs, as they are arranged syntagmatically and paradigmatically. The syntagmatic level involves the sequential combination of signs, whereas the paradigmatic level consists of possible signs that can substitute for each other within a linguistic community's consensus.

Understanding signs as operating within a relational framework is key to grasping their significance. Meanings are not inherent but are socially constructed through interrelations among signs. Saussure's perspective highlights the importance of the relations between signs in creating meaningful communication, underscoring the symbolic nature of language.
