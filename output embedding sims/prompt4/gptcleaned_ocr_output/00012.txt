Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure in linguistics. He states the systematic theory of language and its components. Langue is the systemic part of language, indifferent to individual expression; it covers the societal aspect of language (Barthes, 1967). Saussure explains the linguistic system within a social dimension. The structure level involves a common ground shared by society, stabilized and standardized. Parole, on the other hand, is individual and flexible as it represents individual expression. Language is a social institution and a system of values, a collective contract necessary for communication. Speech, on the other hand, is an individual act of selection and actualization (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Saussure divides the language system into signified and signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning, expressed through the signifier. The relationship between the concept and the external form is arbitrary, not predetermined. Meaning is generated through the selection and combination of signs within the syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes. The syntagmatic consists of a sentence structure, while the paradigmatic involves a set of possible signs. Signs derive meaning from their relationships with each other, rather than external reference (Barker, 2002, p. 29).

In summary, language involves constructing meaning from within, based on internal relations of signs. Signs are meaningful in their relationships and generate meaning through their arrangement within a signifying system.
