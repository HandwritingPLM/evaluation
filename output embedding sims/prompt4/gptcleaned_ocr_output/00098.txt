The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

Commercialization of culture in the United States and the prevalence of advertising were something with no correlative experience to the advertising industry in the United States (De Grazia, 1962, p.22). Adorno was later to allude to his experience in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical research as being indistinguishable from political (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with

Because of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Doblin, and several of which found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood movies must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany. These preconditions, Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industry, are all important to an understanding of his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 142). Examples of this not specified by Adorno were the Hollywood production system, of the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real alternative to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only serve to reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles as an example of someone who was allowed to innovate and make a name for himself outside what the culture industry allowed him to do. For Adorno, freedom of thought in the culture industry was an instrument that ultimately became the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic concentration only meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136).

Adorno ultimately betrays his focus on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The Science of Musi being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture. Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system is interested in diverting people from politics or amusement, and that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culture industry, Besides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry, Adorno specifically defines avai

In his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The Science of Music being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture. Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system is interested in diverting people from politics or amusement, and that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culture industry. Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry, Others see them as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture (Jameson, 1998). Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis.
