1. GENESIS OF “THE CULTURE INDUSTRY”

In order to understand the genesis of the culture industry, and the essence of propaganda and its impact, the concept can be traced logically, from its preconditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies. Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin did not have a teaching position that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno essentially became Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin’s death, “it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had a significant impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began operating there. The Nazis' rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jürgen Habermas would later note, the fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical experiences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48). Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frankfurt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late 1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin’s more optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A primary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu impossible” (Adorno, 2001b, p.47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was essential for artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was a challenge against the authority of a Platonic order from the top - the original or Idea - to the layers of imitations downward; to Adorno, mass production was a denial of authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt School was that of Adorno. In 1941, who had succeeded in establishing a relationship for the Institute of Social Research that enabled the Institute to continue working in New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Radio Research Project, directed by Lazarsfeld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted the position, although he later claimed not to know what a radio listener was. He and rked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.
