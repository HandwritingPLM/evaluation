Like many other structuralist scholars, to Saussure, the linguistic element is not fixed but rather set by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter refers to the conventions necessary for communication, disregarding the material it conveys; in contrast, speech (parole) comprises the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1967, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure of langue is the social convention or value shared throughout society, which is stabilized and standardized. On the other hand, parole is flexible because it represents the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that individual speech cannot be free from shared convention, the structure. 

A language is, therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It represents the social aspect of language and essentially acts as a collective contract that one must fully accept in order to communicate. Due to language being a system of contractual values, it resists modifications from any single individual, establishing itself as a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and a system, speech is primarily an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaker can use the language code to express personal thoughts. Speech corresponds to an individual act due to its combination of existing elements rather than pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15). 

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes between the signified and the signifier. The signified refers to the concept or meaning, and the signifier represents the external form of language, for example, the written and spoken forms of the word "dog" representing the concept. The form expressing the actual dog in English or Korean are the external forms, while the animal itself represents the concept. Saussure argues that language operates independently of reality and constructs meaning through the organization of signs within its system. This interrelation between signs is not reflecting a pre-existent external reality but rather constructs meaning through internal relationships imposed by the linguistic community. 

In considering the paradigmatic and syntagmatic aspects of language, Saussure establishes that a sentence is formed through the linear combination of signs in the paradigmatic scope, allowing for the substitution of one sign with another. Signs within the paradigmatic system generate meaning through the relations between signs, rather than the signs themselves directly carrying meaning. The meaningfulness of signs is established through their relationship to one another in a particular context and context of use within the linguistic system (Saussure, 1955).
