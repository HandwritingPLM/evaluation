1. Defining Uncertainty

A key aspect of interpersonal communication is defining uncertainty (Gudykunst & Ting-Toomey, 1988, p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to involve face-to-face interaction, or communication as...

Defining Uncertainty

One way to consider uncertainty is to examine the concept's origin and definitions. One method of understanding uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high number of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal. They related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, which also contributed to the development of uncertainty reduction theory (URT). Berger and Calabrese (1975) incorporated ideas from information theorists and Heider's (1958) research on attribution to define uncertainty in interpersonal communication as the "number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). Higher levels of uncertainty in a situation decrease the likelihood of individuals predicting behaviors and events. During interactions, individuals not only face challenges in predicting present and past behaviors, but also in understanding partners' beliefs and actions. Berger and Bradac (1982) emphasized the complexity of uncertainty by stating, "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say." Uncertainty plays a crucial role in relationships, as high uncertainty can impede relational development, causing stress and anxiety that may result in low levels of communicator competence (West & Turner, 2000). Incompetent communicators may struggle to establish relationships or engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) suggest that improved communication competence leads to increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, greater intimacy, and enhanced predictability in interactions, ultimately aiming to improve future interactions. While individuals often seek to reduce uncertainty, excessive certainty and predictability can also hinder a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) note that much certainty and predictability can diminish a relationship.
