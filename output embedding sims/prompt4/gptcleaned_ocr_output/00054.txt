1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research in communication initially focused on persuasion, then explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, and consistency. Heider, a forefather of social psychology,

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication focused on social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored social balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, Heider, et al., played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers like Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by scholars such as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the 1970s and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger, along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, were prominent. Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication focuses on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been well-established that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).

Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our understanding of interpersonal processes.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave” (p. 100). The greater the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say.” Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can cause stress and anxiety which can lead to low levels of communicator competence (West & Turner 2000). Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or may be too anxious to engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty cause stress and anxiety which can lead to low levels of communicator competence. Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or may be too anxious to engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty are expected to increase verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and predictability with the goal being to increase predictability with the goal being to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty exists it is often difficult to reach this goal. Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty and predictability can also inhibit a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty and predictability can deaden a relationship; a
