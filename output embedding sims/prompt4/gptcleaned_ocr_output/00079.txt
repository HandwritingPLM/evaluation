1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the 1970s and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and others, along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and others. Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our understanding of interpersonal processes.

1. Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct necessary for the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver also contributed to the expansion of the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal interactions by considering the “number of alternative ways in which the ‘number of alternative things we can believe or potentially say to each interactant exists in a situation, the smaller that level of uncertainty that and occurrences. During interactions individuals are involved can predict behaviors but also predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac (1982) defined uncertainty as a strange process when they stated that a stranger is “someone whose behavior is unpredictable” (p. 100).

The greater the uncertainty, the less likely individuals are to be able to predict behaviors. Individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting an individual’s future actions, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way they do. Berger and Bradac (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this construct. Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things an individual can believe or potentially say. High levels of uncertainty can cause stress and anxiety which can lead to low levels of relational development. Uncertainty can severely inhibit relationships, which can lead to low levels of intimacy and liking. West and Turner (2000) state that incompetent communicators may not be able to engage in initial interactions or may be too anxious to communicate effectively. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty can cause increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking. Greater levels of uncertainty can decrease predictability within a relationship which can lead to difficulties in reaching this goal.

In interactions, individuals are expected to increase their ability to predict and explain what will occur in the future. However, it may be difficult to reach this goal. In interactions individuals are expected to increase their ability to predict what will occur in the future. However, high levels of uncertainty can lead to complexity in interaction. Individuals are loyal that this will lead to increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, and predictability. When high uncertainty exists in interaction, individuals are faced with problems of predictability and explanation. Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty and predictability can also inhibit a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) state that too much certainty and predictability can deaden a relationship.
