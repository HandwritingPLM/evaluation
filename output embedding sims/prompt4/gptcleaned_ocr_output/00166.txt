1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in Europe. The closest thing in the United States was something with no correlative in Europe. Adorno's experience to the closest thing was with fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122). The culture industry in the United States (Jager, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the project would later influence him to further develop his ideas on the culture industry. Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California, and the relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industry, are all important to an understanding of his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not present itself as art. They were instead a business and this, in turn, legitimized the intentionally produced mass deception (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 99). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism. In this system, mass production techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in the cultural sphere. Examples of this were the Hollywood film industry and the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Mechanical reproduction ensured that a system would emerge and that nothing truly adversarial would arise.

Adorno specifically was presenting an alternative to the dominant system of the culture industry. He rejected the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry but instead noted that the dominant system provided mass consumption for entertainment or amusement. Adorno focused on the idea of a defense of high art against the culture industry. Horkheimer and Adorno defined avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry. Adorno's work can be seen as a critique of the culture industry as an adversary.
