I, EARLY INFLUENCES

Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication. The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce uncertainty. The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication, and the influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger's theories highly influenced the emerging field of interpersonal communication and the development of Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT).

Cognitive Dissonance and Comparative Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) attempted to explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another (West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and discomfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social comparison can result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese link social comparison to URT by stating that Festinger's theory that persons seek out similar others who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation. Festinger received the Distinguished Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist Award from the Society for Experimental Social Psychology. Aronson (in Festinger, 1980) stated: “It was in this book, in cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, it has remained the same since” (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in 
    
Europe, worked with many renowned psychologists such as
Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin's stimulating influence, which has affected much of Heider's work. Heider moved to the United States in 1929 and settled in Kansas, where he worked for the remainder of his career.
