Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

He complained to the dean about the radical students in his classes who were vocal in the level of 1968-69 students occupied a number of Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research. After this ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, Pane with one “tasteless demonstration” in which three females bared their breasts. Adorno died a few years later (BSS, 2004, p. 201.08).

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been numerous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about “the commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, believing that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the system as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno’s idea of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s. While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial societies between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 146-48). Thus, for some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.

Thus for some critics, modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and hence, society. Since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culture industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. It is nonetheless the case that motion pictures are still made by large companies and that their movies largely rely on formulaic plots. It is also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by a small number of companies, which tend to impose restrictions on how stations operate. The broadcast medium, television, is very much related to the politics that situate in the culture industry. While there is a certain level of openness online (in that anyone can create a website), it happens that the big tech companies behind the internet continue to maintain an ideological function. For example, viewpoints on MSNBC or Yahoo that would question and impact political decisions. A reexamination of the idea of the culture industry may be needed to understand how mass communication media propagate dominant ideologies.
