1. Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to understand the creation of the culture industry, it must be examined chronologically, from its preconditions to its impact. The culture industry grows out of a concern with the production of culture, and is ultimately manifested in movies. That this is so, grows out of an idea of the culture industry as well as its reception, the concept can be found in historical conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of concern with culture is developed through insights into the mechanical reproduction of culture, generated in opposition not only to popular music but also to Hollywood, due to a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became close friends. Adorno never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno became, in effect, Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin’s death, it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy (Jager, 2004, p.65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, he began teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to his political views. Horkheimer already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and they began operating there. The rise of the Nazis to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job, but it also affected his philosophical stance since the fact that labor movements were co-opted in the Nazi regime influenced the development of critical theory.

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, and he looked forward to joining his Frankfurt colleagues in the United States. Adorno remained an outsider, never integrating into the British academic scene. Upon returning to the United States, Adorno worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered to be an expert on the positron, having worked with Lazarsfeld in the United States.

As commercialization of propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass media. Radio became one of the most popular means of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p.24). During the 1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture; Adorno was a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's article “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p.62). While Benjamin argued for the emancipation of art from hierarchical tastes tied to class, Adorno took a position that mass reproduction challenged the authenticity of art. To Adorno, mass reproduction was not about freeing the work of art from hierarchies, but about the destruction of authenticity. This led to a difference in approach between them in establishing critical theory.

In 1938, Max Horkheimer, who succeeded to lead the Institute in collaboration with Columbia University, established the Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazarsfeld. Adorno continued to work with members of the Institute, conducting research in the hopes of adapting to a new medium: radio. For Adorno, radio was not just about music, but about disseminating propaganda. Adorno questioned the claim by Lazarsfeld that the medium was neutral (Jager, 2004, p.243). While working on the radio project, Adorno remained critical of the mass media in the United States.

The commercialization of society had an impact on both Adorno and Benjamin, who were shocked by the extent to which culture had become commercialized. Their friendship had a profound effect on the development of critical theory. Benjamin became shocked at Walter Benjamin in 1923, and they became close friends. Eventually, Adorno became Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin’s death, it was Adorno who introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy (Jager, 2004, p.99-0). Upon returning to Frankfurt, Adorno continued to develop his thought and establish critical theory.
