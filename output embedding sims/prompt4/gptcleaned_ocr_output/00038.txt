INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

1. THE CULTURE

The Advertising industry in the United States had gone far beyond anything relative in Europe. The closest thing in Adorno's experience to this was fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122). Adorno had later alluded to his experience with the culture industry by noting the statistical division of culture in the United States and its commercialization in Europe (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). Lazarsfeld and Adorno had disagreements on the value of empirical studies, leading Adorno to leave the Princeton Radio Research Project and further develop the idea of the culture industry.

Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, involvement with the expatriate community in California, and the relationship of several members to the Hollywood film industry were all important to the understanding of his concern for the culture industry.

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not present itself as art but as a business, legitimizing the intentionally produced trash. This business, based on Fordist capitalism, implemented mass production techniques, centralization, and hierarchy in the cultural sphere (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 142). Mechanical reproduction in the system ensured no real change or opposition could emerge, ultimately serving as a form of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120).

Adorno's Culture Industry has been criticized as a defense of high art against popular culture. He defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry, but does not provide a Marxist analysis. Adorno presents high art as an alternative to popular culture, utilizing capacities for mass consumption for entertainment (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002).
