Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. According to Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system, and the variation by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which composes it. On the other hand, parole covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 1967, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. In contrast, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is, therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract that one must accept in its entirety to communicate. Language resists modifications coming from a single individual, making it a social institution. unlike language, which is both an institution and a system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the language with a view to expressing personal thoughts. Speech corresponds to an individual act and not a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form signifier. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word "dog" in English or in Korean are external forms expressing the actual animal dog. The concept in question becomes the signified. Saussure (1959) proposed using the terms signified and signifier to designate the whole and replace concept and sound-image, respectively. The relation between the concept/meaning and the external form is arbitrary, not destined. The difference between the signs operates the signifying system, not an inevitable internal relation (Saussure, 1960).

Saussure argues that language constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences. Meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g., a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms). Signs are organized into a signifying system. The syntagmatic comprises a sentence, while the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. The selection of signs within the same paradigmatic is regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members (Barker, 2002, p. 29).

Saussure emphasizes that signs do not make sense by reference to entities in an independent object world. They generate meaning through relations between signs, showing that meaning is a social convention organized through these relations (Barker, 2002, p. 29). The organization of signs into a sequence generates meaning through cultural conventions within a particular context.
