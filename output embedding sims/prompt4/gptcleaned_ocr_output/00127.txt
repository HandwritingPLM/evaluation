CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase And it is careful planning more

the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning

than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity.

Furthermore, Bernays' theories also represent a different view of propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22). In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. "The public is not an amorphous mass which can be molded at will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in attempting to influence the public, business must study what terms the partnership can be made amicable and mutually beneficial to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann as he recognizes the power of society, but still claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to understand and evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect all, to evaluate efforts made by others, and to persuade or suggest courses of action" (p. 10). Under this frame rk, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not such blatant without the public inic Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tended to e with this point.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories
recent research that is meant to help us understand the role media plays in shaping public opinion. The work of Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lippmann, and Ellul has helped define the different effects and limited effects of media models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to emphasize the theory that the direct effects model of propaganda could directly influence the thoughts of others. Meanwhile, Lippmann also noted that the media might not be influencing thoughts but could be influencing what people thought about. It was this line of thinking that set the starting point for future research in the area of the limited effects of media. Such limited effects are now being examined by Iyengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw, among other scholars discussing the media's role in shaping public opinion. While the theories presented in this paper have touched on the direct and limited effects of media on public opinion, they continue to pose questions about how opinions and public agendas are formed.
