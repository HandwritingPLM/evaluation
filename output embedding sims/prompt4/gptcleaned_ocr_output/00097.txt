Like many other social scientists, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics.

The linguistic system operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which composes it. Within the social context, langue is the social convention or value shared through a society.

On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression of the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore - a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language to express personal thought. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act, not a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 44-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word dog in English or in Korean express the actual animal dog. Here, the animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. Saussure proposes to retain the word sign (signe) to designate the whole and replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifi√©) and signifier (signifiant), as the latter terms indicate the opposition separating them from each other and from the whole (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis (ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not in the destined relation, but rather, the arbitrary relation. It is the difference between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that "language does not reflect a pre-existent and external reality, but constructs meaning from within itself through a series of phonic differences". According to Saussure, meaning is produced through a process of combination of signs along both the syntagmatic (e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g. synonyms), organized into a signifying system (Barker, 2002, p. 29). As a grammatical underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sequence and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting signs within the paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community. For example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, let's consider the sentence "I went to the theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is established through a combination of signs. The signs, such as theater, can be substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "cinema". Through the syntagmatic and paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are not understood as independent entities, but rather in relation to one another. "It is central to Saussure's theory that signs gain their meaning through structural convention in relation to a particular context.
