Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the public opinion (Bernays, 1955) and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing the public opinion (Bernays, 1955). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase, the engineering of consent public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). In contrast to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, "The public can be molded at will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p.66), emphasizing that in attempting to influence the public, a business must create a relationship that is amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (Bernays, 1955, p. 66). Bernays's theories also present public relations as a tool that can be utilized effectively by understanding the needs of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations professional helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). While manipulation of the public is possible under this framework, it is not done in blatant ignorance of public opinion. Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tend to disagree with this point.

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that the public is able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more recent research aimed at understanding the influence of the media on the public. Through the work of Yengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, McCombs, and Shaw, a more nuanced understanding of the media has been developed. The public has now been made aware of various media functions such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects that these techniques can have on audiences.

The theories presented in this paper align heavily with the direct effects model, whereby the media could directly influence the thoughts of the public. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann, Ellul, and Bernays also suggest that the media might not only be influencing thought but also influencing what is thought about. This recognition of the limits of media influence is evident in the work of McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of these scholars has been very important to the understanding of the media and its influence on public opinion. While the theories were formulated years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
