Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange, in which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty, is a basic human function. Uncertainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that reducing uncertainty was a central motive. Berger and Calabrese pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining the acquisition of information.

Through the development of URT, these scholars focused on "One of the motivations with which to reduce uncertainty in all fields of communication," but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical understanding underpinning interpersonal communication. URT placed a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Calabrese noted, "When communication researchers have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points." The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of interpersonal communication research with a focus on empirical research for greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social sciences.

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview
Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field, most often linked to studies into language, social cognition, and social psychology. Interpersonal communication is a central term because scholars wanted to study it as a significant and unique aspect of human behavior. Research in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, finding that psychiatric problems were not only a result of self-problems but a result of relational problems as well. Research trends in humanistic psychology and existentialism inspired the idea that relationships could be improved through effective communication.
