1. Needs and Gratifications

The study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 stated five basic assumptions regarding the relationship between media and audiences:

1. The audience is considered active and an important part of mass media use is assumed to be goal-oriented. Media use patterns are shaped by specific expectations of what certain content offers the audience.

2. In the mass communication process, much of the initiative in linking need gratification and media choice lies with the audience. This limits theorizing about any direct effect of media content on attitudes and behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction, as the needs served by mass communication are only part of the wider range of human needs.

4. Methodologically, many of the goals of mass media use can be understood based on data provided by individual audience members. People are self-aware enough to report their interests and motives in specific cases.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while exploring audience orientations on their own terms (p.15-17).

Furthermore, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch noted that previous research on gratifications identified various gratifications that attract people to the media but did not address the connections between these gratifications. They suggested that uses and gratifications research should focus on the social and psychological origins of needs, expectations of the mass media or other sources, differential exposure, need gratification, and unintended consequences (Katz et al., 1974b, p.20). This laid the theoretical foundation for the uses and gratifications approach, which has been expanded over time, especially with the emergence of new media forms in the digital age.

The uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and self-awareness of media users. Different people use media for various purposes, and the same content can gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not one universal way that people use media, as the reasons for media use are as diverse as media users themselves (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situations, and individual backgrounds, such as education, influence what people seek from media and how they fulfill those needs. Audience members are conscious of and can articulate their motives and gratifications for using different media platforms (McQuail, Blumler, & Brown, 1972).

Perceived needs of audience members drive their choice of media and the gratification they seek, taking into account factors like experience, interests, and social interactions (McQuail, Blumler, & Brown, 1972).
