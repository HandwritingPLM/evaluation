It is well accepted that communication theory, specifically the uses and gratifications approach, has greatly influenced both sociology and communication research over the past several decades. Beginning with the exploration of gratifications theory in empirical studies such as those by Lazarsfeld and Stanton (1944, 1949) and Herzog (1944), researchers have identified a variety of functions served by media. For example, radio soap operas were found to provide emotional support and release (Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948), while newspapers were discovered to offer readers security, shared topics of conversation, and structure to their daily routines (Berelson, 1949). These different dimensions of media usage satisfaction were termed "gratifications" by psychologist Herzog (1944).

The uses and gratifications approach gained prominence from the late 1950s to the 1970s, especially with the rise of television. One of the key scholars in this area is Elihu Katz, known for his contributions to this research field. Katz, both a sociologist and communication researcher, received his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1956 and taught at the University of Chicago for over thirty years. His work on uses and gratifications research laid the foundation for this approach.

Alongside Katz, other scholars like Paul Lazarsfeld have also contributed significantly to the study of gratifications theory, connecting it with media usage patterns. The research by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) highlighted how individuals interact with media to fulfill their needs, rather than being passive recipients. This humanistic approach to media studies underscores the idea that media users actively seek out content that satisfies their needs (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

In conclusion, the uses and gratifications approach has shed light on the complex relationship between media, society, and individuals, emphasizing the role of media in fulfilling users' needs and preferences (Blumler & Katz, 1974).
