Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to understand the creation of the concept, it can be examined chronologically, from its inception through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry grew out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical reproduction of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music but also to Hollywood movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno became, in effect, Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin's death, "it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy" (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and was operating there. The Nazis' rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would be forced to leave Germany but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jurgen Habermas points out, the fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the experiences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the rise of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001). Adorno was considered an outsider, never integrating into the British academic scene. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio were considered fascist under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay "Regression in Listening" is, in effect, a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." Within it, Adorno conveys the negative change in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, music was inferior as it could now be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was that music could now be heard over the radio, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction as destroying the original, stating that "listening help to make escape from the whole impossible" (Adorno, 2001b). With philosophical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the art object was its emancipation from hierarchy. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction entailed the destruction of layers of images essential to the artistic authenticity. The general attitude of the essay was nothing but the destruction of the aura, succeeding in establishing a relationship of authority. Adorno, who had successfully continued working in exile, first with Horkheimer, then on the "Radio Research Project" in the United States. Adorno became shocked at the degree of the masses' consumption of culture as he redesigned the idea of the culture industry, which had been based on historical experiences.
