Elliot's Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in Sociology in 1956 marked the point when communication theories flourished. Influenced by valuable ideas from both psychology and sociology, communication theories have developed significantly over the past 100 years. Researchers have uncovered higher conceptions of understanding media effects, including the original uses and gratifications approach proposed by Elihu Katz. Katz's contribution to the structure of this approach has been significant. Katz, along with other scholars, studied how individuals use the media to fulfill their needs and established that people select media sources that best meet their requirements. They also identified that media serves various functions such as surveillance, correlation, entertainment, cultural transmission, among others (Blumler & Katz, 1974). The uses and gratifications approach gained prevalence from the late 1950s to the 1970s, coinciding with the growth of television. By exploring the gratifications that motivate individuals to engage with media, researchers have enriched the field of mass communication research. Studies on radio programs, soap operas, quizzes, and newspapers have revealed the diverse dimensions of usage satisfaction. Psychologist Herzog (1944), for instance, used the term "gratifications" to describe the functions served by specific content. Katz's work in establishing the uses and gratifications approach has been influential, connecting the concept of gratifications with functional theory models. Overall, the exploration of media effects and individual motivations for media use has greatly advanced our understanding of communication.
