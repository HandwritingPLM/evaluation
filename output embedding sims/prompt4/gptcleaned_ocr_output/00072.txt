Defining Uncertainty

Communication initiated for persuasion,
Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication explores social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of uncertainty, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather voice, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers like Bales, Berelson, Katz, Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of scholars such as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the 1970s and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger emerged, along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Pearson. Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal research agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our understanding of interpersonal processes.
