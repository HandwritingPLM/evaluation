1. RETURN TO GERMANY

When Dialectic of Enlightenment and Philosophy of New Music were published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late 1940s, the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954, Adorno published an essay entitled "How to Look at Television" that was the result of a study that had been done for the Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay, Adorno warned, "rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed of psychological control" (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments of the fifties (JÃ¤ger, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on "The Culture Industry Reconsidered." In 1966, when writing the essay "Transparencies on Film," Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

2. One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving ideological ends, for Marcuse, social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions (Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno had done. In the end, Marcuse's analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant ideology. Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individuals who have made their mutilation into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scale liberate themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thinkable that the vicious circle be broken?" (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the book, it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist movements of the 1960s in the U.S. and Germany that developed an oppositional stance. In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated into practice (Chambers, 2004, p. 226).

In reviewing the text in 1961, Friedrich Pollock reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that the work required too much revision to receive mass dissemination. The two authors continued to negotiate with the Fischer publishing house until 1969 and may have only agreed to republish the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals.
