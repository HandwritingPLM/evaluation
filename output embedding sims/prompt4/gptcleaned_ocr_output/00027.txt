1. EARLY INFLUENCES

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication. The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics. Lewin had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and furthered Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) which attempted to show how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Festinger is also known for his observations regarding attitude change in small groups and how relationships occur among individuals when the cognitions in question have no effect on one another (West & Turner, 2000).
Festinger's theories had a substantial impact on contemporary social science research. Aronson (1980) stated that "Festinger has suggested that people compare themselves with others to decrease uncertainty, and this idea has entered the mainstream of research and theory in social psychology." Festinger's theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research.

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz, where he worked with renowned philosophers such as Wolfgang KÃ¶hler and Kurt Koffka. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin's ongoing influence, which has affected much of his own work. Heider later moved to the United States to Kansas where he lived for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000). Heider's work with balance theory and attribution theory has had a significant impact on the field of interpersonal communication. As Heider (1958) stated, "I have profited immensely from my predecessors, but have benefited no less from my own formulations as they have defined themselves directly from my work." Heider's influence on the field of interpersonal communication is still strongly felt today.
