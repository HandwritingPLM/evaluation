In 1954 Adorno published an essay entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the George Gerbner and others. warned that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture, it is strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal weakness in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966 when writing the essay Transparency on Film Adorno conceded that filmmaking might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl 1995, p. 131).

One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609) Instead of culture serving ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p- 83) The entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control Echoing Adorno Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions (Marcuse 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno had done. In the end Marcuse's analysis of society allowed individuals who have made their mutilation into their own liberties and satisfactions, and from their masters? How is it even thinkable that the asked for no opposition to the dominant

Marcuse wrote "how can the administered individuals who have made their mutilation into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scale, liberate themselves from themselves as well as from their masters?"
