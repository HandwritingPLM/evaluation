= Like all structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. Saussure's linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized area of communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which conveys it, while speech (parole) covers the purely individual aspect (Barthes, 1967, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension; langue is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and systematized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. It is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the social conventions and rules of language.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language; it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not to a pure creation. 

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word "dog" in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. Saussure argues that "language does not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, organized into a signifying system. As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the following sentence: "I went to a theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is established through the linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as theater, my, and girlfriend can be substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She went to a restaurant with her friend." Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when they are related to each other. Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of reference to an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each other. Thus, meaning is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs. It is central to Saussure's argument that red is meaningful in relation to the relationship between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into syntax which generated meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
