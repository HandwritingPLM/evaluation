Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has transformed research and the development of communication theory. Information plays a vital role in human function, in which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uncertainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard Calabrese (1975), emphasized that reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. They pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations for interaction is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 15).

URT has applications to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced the research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT placed a focus on uncertainty reduction which was a key step in the development of the field of communication.

Berger and Calabrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted studies of the communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points.” The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the advancement of interpersonal communication research; with the development of URT, communication scholars began to prioritize communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical sciences.

Traditionally, communication has been most often linked to studies into language. However, a modest amount of research in human behavior by Heath and Bryant (2000) marked this time as a period where scholars adopted communication as a key element of human behavior in the interpersonal field. Research trends in human behavior emphasized the importance of effective communication in solving interpersonal and psychiatric problems.
