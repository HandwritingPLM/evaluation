At various stages in his work, Saussure considers language "as a social institution and a system of values." It is a collective contract that must be accepted in its entirety for communication to be successful. Language is resistant to modifications from a single individual due to its nature as a system of contractual values. In contrast, speech is an individual act of selection and actualization, allowing the speaker to express personal thoughts using the language code. Speech corresponds to an individual act of combination, not pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Saussure's linguistic system involves a distinction between the signified and the signifier at the systematic level. The signified represents a concept or meaning, while the form is the signifier, the external part of language expressing the concept. Saussure uses the terms signified and signifier to emphasize their opposition and their relationship within the whole system. The correspondence between the concept and the external form is arbitrary, not predetermined. Language constructs meaning internally through differences between signs, rather than reflecting an external reality (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis (ed.), p. 37).

Meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along the syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes. The syntagmatic axis involves linear combinations of signs in a sentence, while the paradigmatic axis involves the substitution of signs. Signs generate meaning by reference to each other within the system of language, not independently. Therefore, signs only operate in relation to each other, creating a meaningful sequence through their organized differences (Barker, 2002, pp. 29-30).
