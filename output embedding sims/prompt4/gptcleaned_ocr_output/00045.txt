It is well accepted that communication theories developed through the social psychology over the past 100 years have been illuminated by valuable insights as well as exploring more untilled fields.

Two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally stemmed from a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory communication agrees with messages towards people. For example, a study used in the thermic Syringe that "the media have a direct, immediate and influence upon audiences by 'injecting' information into the masses" (Watson & Hill, 1997, p.105). Functional theories influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift which rediscovered the role of media and people led to the establishment of uses and gratifications.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became interested in different radio programs, such as soap operas and daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Katz, 1944, 1949; Lazarsfeld, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; et al.). In their studies, researchers did a list of functions served either by the specific content or by the media itself (Katz et al., 1974). They found to satisfy their listeners with advice, support, or occasions for emotional release (Lazarsfeld, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just information, newspapers were also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of us (1944) marked the term "gratifications" prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown each were perceived when it was recovered during that era. Among gratifications research, Elihu Katz is the most well-known figure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a theorist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from the University of Chicago and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During his time there, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University. Invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication from the 1970s to 1990s (UPENN, 2001). In 1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral students. Katz's mentor at Columbia University was Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one of the pioneers of gratifications. Their cooperation produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the functional theory. Later, Katz introduced the uses and gratification approach when he came up with the notion that people media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, Haas (1973), a subject which is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a means by which individuals connect or disconnect with others and found that people bend the media to their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch, Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication: a more humanistic approach looking at media. They suggest that media users seek a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user, and they have alternate choices to select (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They argue that media
