year 1951 the Wied Lenne Cultural Institute (opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer
became a professor at the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay

Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of G. Horkheimer,
warned, rigid institutionalization could transform modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
proportions (Horkheimer, 1995, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s
discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural events (Jager, 2004, pp. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thoughts on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 531).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination (Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass

media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
