: There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:

"Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)" (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined

this term as "the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other

of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
