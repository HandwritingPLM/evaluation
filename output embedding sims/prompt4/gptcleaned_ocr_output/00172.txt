One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation (Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno had done. In the end, Marcuse's analysis of society called for no opposition to the dominant ideology in the administered individuals who have made their mutilation large-scale liberate.
