1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Uses and Gratifications

Here, we focus on the motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. It is concluded that different people can use the same communication content for different reasons. People may gratify different needs for using the media as there are media. 

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual’s background, such as education, affect people’s ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. There are as many reasons as experiences, interests, and interactions.

McGuire (1974) suggested another subdivided version of the audience's motivation based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotion stability of "growth" and "preservation." When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations that apply to media use (Figure 1).

Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

Important media gratifications: 
(1) Diversion
(2) Personal relationships
(3) Identity exploration; value reinforcement
(4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking)

Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;

Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status;

Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and

Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Similarly, McQuail (1983) classified the following common reasons for media use:

- finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world
- seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision choices
- satisfying curiosity and general interest learning; self-education
- gaining a sense of security through knowledge
- finding reinforcement for personal values
- finding models of behavior
- identifying with valued others (in the media)
- gaining insight into oneself
