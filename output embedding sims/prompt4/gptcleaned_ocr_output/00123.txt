1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

The uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motivation: individuals use media for very different purposes. The same media can fulfill a variety of needs and gratifications for individuals. There is not only one way that individuals use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for media use as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Social situations, an individual's needs, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and beliefs, shape people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. Audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications (McQuail, Blumler, & Brown, 1972).

They proposed a model of “media-person interaction” to classify four important media gratifications: 
(1) Diversion: escape from routine or stress; emotional release;
(2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility;
(3) Personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement;
(4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

McGuire (1974) suggested a subdivided version of the audience's motivation, based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus “internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974).

Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status;
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

McQuail (1983) classified the following common reasons for media use:

- finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world;
- seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision choice;
- satisfying curiosity and general interest;
- education;
- security through knowledge;
- learning; self-improvement;
- gaining a sense of security;
- finding reinforcement for personal values and behavior;
- finding models of others (in the media);
- identifying with valued others;
- gaining insight into oneself.
