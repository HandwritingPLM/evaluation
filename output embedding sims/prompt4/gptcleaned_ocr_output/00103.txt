Communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology, enriched by valuable ideas as well as exploring more uncharted fields in these areas to elicit a series of higher levels of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of media studies, the uses and gratifications approach is suggested to have originally stemmed from a functional paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory on communication aligns with media's effects on people. For example, a model often used in the theory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, posits that "the mass media have a direct, immediate, and influential effect upon audiences by 'injecting' information into the consciousness of the masses" (Watson & Hill 1997, p. 105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. Following that, a shift occurred which rediscovered the relationship between media and people and led to the establishment of the uses and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programs, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well as daily newspapers (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.). In these studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice, support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering information, newspapers were also discovered to be important in giving readers a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) labeled them with the term "gratifications."

The uses and gratifications approach became prevalent in the late 1950s until the 1970s as television grew. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed during that time. Among the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. Over the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work on broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication from the 1970s to 1990s (UPENN, 2001). In 1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor at Columbia University was Paul Lazarsfeld, one of the pioneers of gratifications research. Their collaborative work produced important developments that connect the concept of gratifications with the functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced the uses and gratification approach when he proposed that people utilize the media for their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), the subject known as uses and gratifications research was explored. They viewed the mass media as a means by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people adapt the media to their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 entitled "The Uses of Mass Communication." They took a more humanistic approach to examining media use. They suggested that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills their needs, and they have alternate choices to satisfy those needs (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission for both society and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
