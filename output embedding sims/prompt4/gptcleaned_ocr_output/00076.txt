Like many other structuralist scholars, to Saussure, the linguistic mechanism is a tool for representing an independent reality and the view of talking actors. The former is called langue and the latter is parole, a kind of convention necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the speech itself. In contrast to it, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language structures (Ot p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within a social dimension. The structure langue is the social convention or value shared through society which is stabilized and shared On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from
the shared convention, the structure, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is a combinative activity that it corresponds to a single individual's intention. It is essentially a creation. (Barthes 1967, pp. 14-15) 

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure represents the language system in two parts, the signifier, which is expressed through the form, and the signified, which is the concept or meaning. The form is called the signifier. For example, both the word "dog" in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the concept. In question becomes the concept in question and to replace the concept and the internal part of language structure should contain(signifi√©) and ...
The last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts (Saussure 1959, in R. Innis

2002, p. 29) Asa grammatical set of signs OR the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of the linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntag paradigmatic, lets consider the following sentence "| went to a theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example such as theater, My, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic such as "She went to a restaurant with her money."
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when
they are related to each other. Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of letters es
an independent object world, rather, they generate meaning by reference to each other. Thus,

ea 29). It is central to Saussure that red is meaningful in relation to the difference
between red, green amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates
