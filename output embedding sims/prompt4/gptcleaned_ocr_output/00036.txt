It is well accepted that communication theory has evolved significantly within the field of sociology over the past 100 years. With the work of researchers like Becca Gar in src, the researchers elicited a series of higher conceptions of observational mode concepts. The media effects research, using a scientific approach, is suggested to have originally stemmed from a functional perspective (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory on communication aligns with the idea of media's effects on people. For example, a model often used in the theory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, posits that "the mass media have a direct, immediate, and influential effect upon audiences by 'injecting' information into the consciousness of the receivers" (Watson & Hill, 1997, p. 105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 19, which rediscovered the relationship between media and people and led to the establishment of the uses and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers examined audience responses to media content such as soap operas and quizzes, among others (Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948). In these studies, researchers identified various functions served either by specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to provide listeners with advice, support, or emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948). Newspapers were also noted to offer readers a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and a structure to their daily routine (Berelson, 1949). These diverse dimensions of usage satisfaction were marked by psychologist Herzog (1944) with the term "gratifications."

The uses and gratifications approach became prevalent in the late 1950s to the 1970s as television grew in popularity. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed during that era. Among the scholars who focused on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known and made significant contributions to establishing the approach.

Elihu Katz served as both a sociologist and a communication researcher. He earned his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and taught at the University of Chicago until 1963. Over the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, Katz was invited by the Government of Israel to lead the task force responsible for the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience shaped his subsequent academic work on broadcasting, television, leisure, culture, and communication from the 1970s to the 1990s (UPENN, 2001). In 1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania and directed its experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor at Columbia University was Paul Lazarsfeld, one of the pioneers of gratifications research. Their collaborative work produced important connections between the concept of gratifications and the functional theory model. Katz introduced the uses and gratifications approach by proposing that people use the media for their own benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), the concept of uses and gratifications research was explored. They viewed mass media as a way for individuals to connect or disconnect with others, finding that people adapt the media to their needs more readily than the media influences them (Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas, 1973).

Together with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974, titled "The Uses of Mass Communication." They took a more humanistic approach to understanding media use, suggesting that media users seek out sources that best fulfill their needs and that they have alternative choices to satisfy those needs (Blumler & Katz, 1974). Additionally, they identified functions of media such as surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission for both society and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
