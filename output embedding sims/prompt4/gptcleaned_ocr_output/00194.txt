1. Return to Germany

We published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing themselves as it could jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late 40s, Frankfurt School appointed Horkheimer as the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954, Adorno published an essay entitled "How to Look at Television", resulting from a study done for the Hacker Foundation with George Gerbner and others. Adorno warned that rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed of psychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p.160). While Adorno did not participate much in cultural developments of the 1950s, he did try to reshape his thoughts on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote about a universal pseudo-culture in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p.21) and in 1963 gave a radio talk in Germany on "The Culture Industry Reconsidered". In 1966, when writing the essay "Transparencies on Film", Adorno acknowledged that film-making could be an acceptable cultural practice against the backdrop of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p.18).

2. One-Dimensional Man and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse provided an analysis of late capitalist society within a comprehensive framework, unlike other Frankfurt School scholars (Wiggershaus, 1994, p.609). Instead of using culture for ideological purposes, Marcuse argued that social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society integrated individuals into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p.144). Capitalist production and resulting wealth created a system of repressive affluence that kept elements of society content and compliant (Alway, 1995, p.83). Society was organized around an ideology aimed at maintaining social control and perpetuating the existing ideology. Like Adorno, Marcuse contemplated whether the informational and entertainment aspects of mass media could be separated from their manipulative and indoctrination functions (Marcuse, 1991, p.8). However, Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass media from the broader dominant ideology as Adorno had done. Ultimately, Marcuse's analysis offered no room for opposition to the prevailing ideology. He posed the question of how individuals, who have internalized their own subjugation, can break free from themselves and their masters (Marcuse, 1991, pp.251). Despite the pessimistic tone of his work, Marcuse became an icon of leftist movements in the U.S. and Germany during the 60s, although he considered himself a philosopher rather than an activist. In 1961, Pollack informed Adorno and Horkheimer that their work needed substantial revisions for broader dissemination. The two authors negotiated with the Fischer publishing house until 1969, possibly agreeing to republish the work due to unauthorized copies circulating among individuals.
