Propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97).

A focus on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno's contribution to the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop the idea of the culture industry.

CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in both Germany and the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in his more limited experience. What he found in Germany was something with no correlative in the United States (Adorno, 2002, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with the Radio Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical analysis, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political.

It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not see eye to eye, which eventually led Adorno to leave the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with

The Culture Industry: For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not simply operate as any other business, and this in turn became an ideology (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business went hand in hand with capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by the industrial sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on central
