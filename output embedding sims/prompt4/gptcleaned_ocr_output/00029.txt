The influence of their work can be seen reflected in

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially

their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation" (p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished
Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's legacy is significant and

Festinger, 1980) "It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since" (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz. During his time in
Europe, Heider worked with many renowned psychologists such as Wolfgang Kohler, Max Wertheimer,
and Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial impact on his life: "I want
to pay tribute to Lewin's stimulating influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which is
still strong even in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work" (Heider, 1958, p-
vii). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of
Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).
