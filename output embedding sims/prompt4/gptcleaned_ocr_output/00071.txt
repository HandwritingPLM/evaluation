Generating propaganda in influencing public opinion. Bernays himself made a statement regarding his phrase, the engineering of consent. He said, "Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning." Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who viewed the public as manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, "The public mind... can be molded at will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in attempting to influence the public, a business must make amicable and mutually beneficial interactions with the public. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives to the public in terms which the public can understand. Bernays elaborates on these ideas in 'Public Relations' (1952). Rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to align the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others, and to persuade or suggest courses of action" (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that the public is able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more recent research that is meant to help understand the influence of the media on the public. With work by Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive picture of the media has been developed. The public has now been made aware various functions of the media such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects that these techniques can have on their audiences.

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects model. Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby media could directly influence the thought of the masses- affecting not only thought, but may also result in action. This serves as a starting point for exploring the effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in this paper aids in the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
