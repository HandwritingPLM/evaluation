Like many scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. According to Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, these being langue and parole. Langue consists of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the speaking actors. On the other hand, parole covers the purely individualistic aspect of expression. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structural level, langue, represents the social convention shared through society which is standardized. In contrast, parole is flexible because it is the individual expression. However, speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure. Language is a systematic system with the systematic set of signs, or material of the signal that composes individual parts of language (Barthes, 1967). Speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization, in contrast to language which is both institution and system (Barthes, 1967). Saussure divided the language system into two parts, focusing on the systematic level. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part indicating the concept in question by designating the whole. The external form is not in direct relations but is an arbitrary relation constructed within the signifying system (Saussure, 1959). Saussure argues that the language doesn't reflect a pre-existing reality of independent objects but constructs meaning from the selection and combination of signs within itself through a syntagmatic and paradigmatic system (Barker, 2002). The relationship between signs is crucial as they generate meaning through the relations within the difference and sequence that generate meaningful understanding.
