1. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses.

In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann (Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda, conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is known for popularizing the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis is defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into specific variables in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication," Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audienceâ€™s opinion, and the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to achieve the goal of understanding the stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content to audience" (p. 74).

This method of content analysis of communication which Lasswell stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom with what effect" is essentially the core of his work and remained so for the remainder of his career. Lasswell was primarily interested in examining the effects of the media on society and public opinion. In this way, Lasswell has created a cycle where the public is both influenced by media and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still essential in the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the media.

Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were active, Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations and propaganda. Bernays defines propaganda as, a consistent effort to create or shape events to influence public perception.
