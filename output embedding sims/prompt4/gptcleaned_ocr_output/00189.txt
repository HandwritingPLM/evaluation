1 Needs and Gratifications

The self-perceived needs of audience mem-
people can use the same communication mes-
needs for different
many reasons.

The Uses and Gratifications approach emphasizes motives a
bers. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different
sage for different purposes. The same media content may gratify differ
individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications
for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person
interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience’s motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus
"internal" goal orientation, and emotional stability of "growth" and "preservation." When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding.
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, and feelings.
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, and status.
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends.
5. Tension release, escape, and diversion.

Incongruously, McQuail’s (1983) class following common media use:

- finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings and the world
- seeking advice on practical matters
- satisfying curiosity and general interest learning; self-education
- gaining a sense of security through media
- finding reinforcement for personal values
- finding models of behavior
- identifying with valued others (in the media)
- gaining insight into oneself
