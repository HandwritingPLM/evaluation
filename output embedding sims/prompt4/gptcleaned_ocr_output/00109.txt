Linking need gratification and This places a strong limitation on the effect of media content on attitudes and. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption certainly varies. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- i.e., people are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their terms. (p. 15-17). In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous research on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifications research concern with the following aspects: "(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2) needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) differential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones" (Katz et al., 1974b, p. 20). The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation for the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and gratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in an electronic information age when people have more options of media use. Needs and Gratifications Gratifications are the self-perceived needs of audience members. The gratifications approach emphasizes motives and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. Contrarily, there are as many reasons media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974). And the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and they want from media and which media best meet their f and can state their motives and gratifications.
