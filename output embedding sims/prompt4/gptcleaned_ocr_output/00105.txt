Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that the public is able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more recent research that is meant to help understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the work of Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of the media has been developed. The public has now been made aware of various media functions such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects that these techniques can have on the formation of public opinion.

The ideas presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects media models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects, suggesting that propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, hypotheses such as those of limited effects also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also shape what people thought about. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for the study of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of Iyengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in this paper has been very valuable to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public, and the formation of public opinion in the society that surrounds us today.
