Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1931. He earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. from Iowa State University. For two years, he served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War. The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory in communication projects. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2004 as he was suffering from kidney failure. He died on October 21, 2005.

Rogers (1995) defines diffusion as the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation is an idea, practice, or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels. In the diffusion theory, time variable is a crucial factor involved in the innovation-decision process, innovativeness, and the rate of adoption. Most innovations typically have an S-shaped rate of adoption.

Rogers (1995) identified five types of adopters in the diffusion process: Innovators (venturesome), Early Adopters (respectable), Early Majority (deliberate), Late Majority (skeptical), and Laggards (traditional) (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers emphasized the importance of understanding the relationships between types of adopters based on innovation. 

Rogers also mentioned that diffusion of innovations can be affected by various factors such as media technology evolution and the digital divide. The diffusion process involves five stages: (1) Knowledge (people become aware of an innovation), (2) Persuasion (people form a positive or negative attitude towards the innovation), (3) Decision (people decide to adopt the innovation), (4) Implementation (people integrate the innovation into regular use), and (5) Confirmation (people evaluate their decision to adopt the innovation).
