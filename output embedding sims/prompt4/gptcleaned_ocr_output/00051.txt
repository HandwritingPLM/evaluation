It is well accepted that communication theories have developed over the past 100 years. With advancements in the two disciplines, researchers have been illuminated by valuable ideas as well as exploring higher concepts of understanding media. As a sub-paradigm in the social sciences, the gratifications approach is suggested to be an original sub-tradition of communication theory (Blumler & Katz, 1974). However, functional theory on communication agrees with media's immediate and influential role. For example, a model often used in the communication field discusses that "the mass media have a direct input of information into the consciousness of the masses" (Watson & Hill, 1997).

The focus on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a relationship between media and people occurred and led to the establishment of uses and gratifications that motivate empirical Mass Communication research itself. Researchers became interested in the reasons for viewing different daily newspapers and what attracts people to certain media. Lazarsfeld's radio soap Operas and quizzes, for example, were found to satisfy their listeners with advice and emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948) rather than just catering to satisfaction purposes.

The Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till the 1970s when television had grown up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication from the 1970s to 1990s (UPENN, 2001). In 1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania and also directed its experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor at Columbia University was Paul Lazarsfeld, one of the pioneers of gratifications research. Their collaborative work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced the uses and gratification approach when he came up with the notion that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), a subject known as uses and gratifications research was explored. They viewed the mass media as a means by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 titled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanistic approach to looking at media where users seek out a medium source that best fulfills their needs and also discovered that media have multiple functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
