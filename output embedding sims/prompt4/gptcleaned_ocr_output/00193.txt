Return to Germany

In the 1940s, the Institute relocated to Frankfurt and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer became the Vice-Chancellor of the University, signifying a rigid institutionalization of psychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in the cultural developments of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film, Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995).

One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society in a systematic context, as opposed to other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of focusing on ideological ends, for Marcuse, social control mechanisms in advanced industrial societies aimed at the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of domination that kept elements of society satisfied and organized around an ideology whose purpose was to maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the information and entertainment aspects of society. Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether individuals could be liberated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions. It is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture of mass of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant ideology administered individuals who have made their mutilation for an enlarged scale, "how can the administrators liberate themselves from themselves and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scale?” Despite the pessimistic tone of the book, Marcuse believed that an oppositional stance could still be developed and that he could serve as an icon for leftist movements. It is somewhat ironic in the U.S. and Germany that Marcuse was seen as a thinker of the 1960s in theory, and not an activist. Marcuse maintained that he was a theoretician – in line with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the practice (Chambers, 2004, p. 226). Friedrich Pollock reported the text in 1961, the two authors continued to revise it until 1969, and may have struggled to find a publishing house until it was ultimately disseminated by individuals as pirate copies had already been distributed.
