1. Needs and Gratifications

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows:

- They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences.
- The audience is conceived as active and assumed to be goal-oriented.
- Members have definite expectations of what content different media have to offer.
- Patterns of media use are shaped by the needs and gratifications of audience members.
- The media competes with other sources of need satisfaction, and the needs served by mass communication make up only a segment of a wider range of human needs.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous research on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people to the media, they did not address the connections between these gratifications. They suggested that uses and gratifications research concerns the social and psychological origins of needs which generate expectations of the mass media or other sources, leading to differential exposure, need gratification, and perhaps unintended consequences.

Today, research on uses and gratifications is still based on Katz's initial analysis, particularly as new forms of media have emerged in the electronic information age, providing audiences with more options for media use.

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes the motives and self-perceived needs of audience members. People can use the same communication messages for different purposes, and the same media content may gratify different needs for different people. Basic needs, social situation, and individual background all influence what people want from media and which media best meet their needs. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: situation, individual background, experience, interests, and education affect people's motives for media use. Audience members are able to recognize their motives and gratifications in media use and can state them clearly.
