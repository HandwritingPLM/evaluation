RETURN TO GERMANY

When their writings were published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the 1940s, the Institute relocated to Frankfurt and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954, Adorno published an article entitled "How to Look at Television" that was the result of a study done for the Hacker Foundation, involving George Gerbner and others. In this essay, Adorno warned that rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of psychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s that Adorno discussed the implications of mass culture. Some observers found it strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not actively engage in the cultural developments of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would occasionally attempt to reshape his thoughts on the culture industry. For instance, in 1959, he wrote about a universal pseudo-culture in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21) and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on "The Culture Industry Reconsidered." In 1966, while writing the essay "Transparencies on Film," Adorno acknowledged that filmmaking might be an acceptable cultural practice in contrast to the culture industry within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

One-Dimensional Man and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse provided an analysis of late capitalist society in a systematic context, unlike other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Marcuse believed that in advanced industrial society, social control mechanisms ensured the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist production and the resulting wealth created a system of repressive affluence that kept elements of society content and passive (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The entire society became organized around an ideology that aimed to maintain social control and perpetuate the ideology supporting that control. Similar to Adorno, Marcuse questioned whether the information and entertainment aspects of mass media could be distinguished from their manipulation and indoctrination functions (Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, Marcuse did not separate culture or mass media from society, as he did not view them as entities distinct from dominant ideology.

In Marcuse's analysis, there was no room for opposition to the dominant ideology. He reflected on how administered individuals, who had accepted their own coercion as freedom and satisfaction, could break free from themselves as well as from their masters. He pondered how the vicious circle of control could be broken (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Despite the pessimistic tone of his analysis, largely because of it, Marcuse was wary of engaging in revolutionary practices in the same way as Adorno (Chambers, 2004, p. 226).

In 1961, Friedrich Pollack reviewed the text and reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that it required significant revision before receiving mass dissemination. The two authors negotiated with the Fischer publishing house until 1969 and agreed to republish the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individual sources.
