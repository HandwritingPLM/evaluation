CULTURE: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States had gone far beyond any prevalence of advertising in Europe. The closest thing in advertising in the United States was something he had seen in fascist propaganda (Jaeger, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later dissatisfied with the culture industry in the United States and stated that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 122).

Adorno did not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project, which would eventually motivate him to further develop his dissatisfaction with the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University. Adorno was finally able to relocate to California and joined an expatriate community that included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Bertolt Brecht, several of which had already moved to California. When Adorno joined an expatriate community that was part of this intellectual community A Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno had inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had in Weimar Germany, movies must have had some influence in developing Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin and his work on the Princeton Radio Project was well noted. overall, the relationship of several of these individuals to the Hollywood film industry is all important to understanding his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produced (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 142). Examples of this were the Hollywood production system, associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies operated on formulas, and the formula supplanted the work (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any true change, and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation in the system would only reaffirm the system and Adorno cited Orson Welles as an example of someone challenging it ineffectually (Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the same freedom to choose in a system of economic and social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136).

Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as an alternative to modernism. Although he presents the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry, it ultimately renders itself ineffective (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120). Adorno provides no overt defense against the high art, but rather utilizes capabilities for mass consumption.

Since Adorno had been criticized for his views on avant-garde art, he notes in his essays on music as a defender of high art, opposed to popular culture as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 101).
