1. Needs and Gratifications

The perceived needs of audience members can influence the same communication message differently, as individuals have different needs for different purposes, and there are as many reasons for media consumption as there are media users. The uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self.

Different people can derive media gratifications for different reasons. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that individuals use media content for very different purposes, with the same media content potentially gratifying diverse individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situations, and individual backgrounds, such as education, influence people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. Audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems, emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship, social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference, reality exploration, value reinforcement, and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivided version of audience motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotional stability of "growth" and "preservation." When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations that apply to media use. 

Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and categorized them into five categories, such as experience, interests, and:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status;
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Similarly, McQuail's (1983) classification includes common reasons for media use, such as finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world, seeking advice on practical matters or opinions and decision choices, satisfying curiosity and general interest, learning, self-education, gaining a sense of security through knowledge, finding reinforcement for personal values, finding models of behavior, identifying with valued others (in the media), and gaining insight into oneself.
