Please send Leo Chase an email, phone or text no later than 3 pm today. Let him know that you are available to meet at that time in your office. Leo is the Director of the University of Boston. Do you think Lied and He are the same person? I believe he can relate to the work he did there. However, I do see that he is very busy with his schedule; we should reschedule our meeting. Please let me know what you think. Thank you. (Acker, 2008). It is also important to remember that Leo was very interested in the subject matter. He likes to keep busy with his work, and get things done. Therefore, we have to be understanding and considerate of his schedule. He may have other priorities.
