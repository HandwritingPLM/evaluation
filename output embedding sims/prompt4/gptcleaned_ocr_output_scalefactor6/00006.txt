Chapter 1: Uncertainty Reduction

Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept and knowledge of interpersonal communication has been a source of research and the development of communication theories in which individuals request, provide, and exchange informal information (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Berger and Rolands, recognized that there was a significant relationship in interpersonal communication that was worth examining.

The study of information has greatly influenced Heath and Urban (1983). According to their research, the degree of uncertainty found in particular adhered theories of communication, related to the research on the effects of interpersonal communication.

Communication researchers have tended to employ social-psychological perspectives in their research on the development of UR. Communication researchers have focused on theories for a greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches for communication and other social aspects. 

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field linked to studies in social science. Heath and Brian noted that prior to this time, research in the field of interpersonal communication had its roots in behavioral studies.

Research trends in communication have primarily focused on understanding communication as the original source of behavior. Studies have looked into issues that arise as a result of relational problems rather than personal problems, leading to trends in human communication psychology and research inspiration.
