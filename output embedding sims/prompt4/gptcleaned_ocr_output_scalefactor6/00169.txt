J. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists
1.0 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a pioneer in researching the workings and qualities and effects of propaganda, and determining the effect of propaganda on the mass media (Rogers, 1964). Generally, content analysis can be defined as, "the observed activities of communication systems by categorizing the content in these systems in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1964) in what he termed "Content of Communication." Lasswell (1948) explained that a content analysis has the role of determining the frequency with which certain elements appear in the message, the direction in which the story is portrayed in the media, the audience's appeal, and the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of these messages, one can also achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influences that flow from content to audience and from content to the gatekeepers."

This method of communication led directly to Lerner's (1952) early definitions of communication which stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom with what effect." Content analysis grew essentially in the area of what Lasswell termed as "who gets what information," and Lasswell did a lot of work in this area defining the trends and his theories concerning them.

Aside from understanding the communal propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion while also working on his own. In his study, Lasswell has outlined a cycle whereby the public lies in the information that is presented to them, and from there, make decisions on how to react to it. However, in Lasswell's eyes, that information was often offered with the goal of influencing their decision within the domain she is in, and also appropriated to suit interests. This can be seen as the power of the media that aligns closely with Lippmann's theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda, Edward Bernays was influencing public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928) defines propaganda as, "an effort to induce changes in the attitudes of individuals to influence the relations among publics or particular groups." Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bernays believed that propaganda can be either beneficial or detrimental to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think about or alter the opinions of individuals but this may actually be beneficial to society as a whole. Bernays asserts, "We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes are formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of." With this power of persuasion, Bernays believed in shaping society.

Based on the idea that public opinion can be manipulated, and that shaping beliefs is a necessary part of society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of public relations. "Public relations is a communicative process by which information, attitudes, opinions are passed from one person to another," he stated.

Likewise, F. Aberle's inspired focus on Counseling, formed a basis for understanding the public and developing a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relations campaign is adjustment of the campaign on the attitudes of various groups in society, gathering information to effectively express an idea, and ultimately, winning people to influence their public opinions in the desired direction.

Bernays' theories were a leap forward for mass communication theory. They moved away from simplistic notions of "information propaganda" and instead focused on a deeper.
