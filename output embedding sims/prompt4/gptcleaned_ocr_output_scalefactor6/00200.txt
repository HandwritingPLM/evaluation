Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception, one must examine its development chronologically. From its pre-conditions through its generation, the widespread impact of the culture industry can be traced. The concept of the culture industry emerged out of a concern with culture, developed through insights into the mechanization of production and is ultimately positioned in opposition not only to popular culture, but also to totalitarian regimes. All of this forms part of the backdrop against which the culture industry emerged.

Adorno was adopted by Walter Benjamin in 1933, and their work together, along with the others, had a significant influence on the development of Adorno’s thought. During this period, Adorno was based in Frankfurt, closely affiliated with the Institute. However, Adorno’s situation changed as the Nazi regime took power, leading him to establish a branch of the Institute in Geneva. This split with Horkheimer not only impacted Adorno’s departure from Frankfurt but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jürgen Habermas has later noted, the fact that labor movements were suppressed in the United States, along with Stalinist repression and the rise of mass culture, contributed to the development of critical theory.

Adorno evidenced the high regard for Benjamin by continuing to expound upon his ideas even after Benjamin's death in 1940. Adorno engaged in debates about culture, establishing key differences regarding propaganda under the Nazi and Stalinist regimes. These debates were central to the evolution of Adorno's thought.

In 1924, Max Horkheimer, who had successfully established a relationship with Columbia University that would later become the basis for Adorno's arrival in the United States, expressed an interest in working with Adorno despite never fully understanding what a "critical project" truly entailed. From this partnership, Adorno would go on to establish a substantial presence in the academic world.
