Uncertainty Reduction

Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabresi, and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of uncertainty has been a cornerstone for communication research and the development of communication theory. Interpersonal communication, which involves individuals exchanging, processing, and sharing information with the goal of reducing uncertainty, has led to the emergence of Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT), credited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized for their contribution to understanding uncertainty in the context of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars have greatly influenced the field of interpersonal communication by emphasizing the role of uncertainty in interpersonal relationships. According to Berger and Calabrese (1975), "One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication theory is the complexities of uncertainty" (p. 123). The study of communication is evolving into a field of interpersonal communication, with its relationship to the study of uncertainty being particularly advanced theoretically. Within the field of interpersonal communication, URT places the act of communication at its core, highlighting the importance of uncertainty in shaping interpersonal communication. Berger and Calabrese (1975) pointed out how scholars have conducted empirical research on interpersonal communication and built on previous psychological theories to form new theoretical perspectives. The research underlying the theory is supported by other scholars' work on the emergence of interpersonal communication. 

The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as a discipline focused on intrapersonal analyses - focusing on individual experiences in relation to various factors. This led to the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Heath and Hayes (2005) described the origins of the field of interconnection as a response to changing social norms. The historical analysis that reveals the deep-seated implications of interpersonal communication offers insight into the complexities and nuances of relationships. In examining the metaphorical nature of communication, relations can be further understood and enhanced.
