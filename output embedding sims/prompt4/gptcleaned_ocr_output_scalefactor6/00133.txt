Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

He complained to the dean about the radical students in his classes who were making his teachings unpopular. The winter and spring of 1966-67 saw students occupy a number of buildings at the University at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research. After the strike ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, including one "tasteless demonstration" in which three females bared their breasts. Adorno died a few months later (Jaeger, 2004, p. 201-201).

Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

The 1872 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since, there have been numerous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about "the commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the generally sympathetic Deborah Gould, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Osborne, 1995, p. 46). Claiming that "capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive fascism" (Adorno, 1991, p. 46). Terry Eagleton conceded that "the distinction of art values and commercial products in a culture industry was highly ambiguous" (Eagleton, 2003, p. 146). Thus, for some critics, the value of modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of a culture industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, as it has led to thoughts about the role of mass communications in contemporary society. Since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about the influence of the culture industry and did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. Yet, pictures are still made by large companies and their movies often have underlying political messages. It's also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by a small number of conglomerates, which seek to impose restrictions on what stations can broadcast. Nevertheless, it happens that the commercial companies operating television channels continue to maintain a ideological function. For example, channels like FOX News, MSNBC, or Yahoo News that would question the prerogatives of corporate America. While a critique of the culture industry may be necessary in order to understand how mass communication media propagate dominant ideologies.
