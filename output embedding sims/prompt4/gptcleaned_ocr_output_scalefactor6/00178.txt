Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

The uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition of media research. The original conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of certain media contents. The core question of much research was: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1952). There exists a basic idea in this approach that people choose content, and which media they use to meet their needs.

The approach is distinct from other perspectives in that it regards audiences as active participants, rather than passive consumers of information. In contrast to traditional media theories which ask "what media do to people" and assume audiences are passive, the uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). It considers individual's motives to use media and responds to their social, emotional, and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also posits that different media platforms and content cater to various public perspectives, allowing audiences to feel empowered by selecting their needs for using media. It also suggests that people are more media literate than previously assumed.

The categories discussed in this chapter will be further examined in subsequent sections of this discipline, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of media and its roles in empowering audiences.
