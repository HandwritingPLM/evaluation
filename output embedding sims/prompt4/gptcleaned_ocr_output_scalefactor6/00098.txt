The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception (Cornell, 1991) focuses on the deception involved in the culture industry, particularly in Europe. The concept of propaganda and the manipulation of public opinion are central themes in the work by Adorno and Horkheimer. They argue that the culture industry perpetuates deception by controlling the means of cultural production and dissemination. This process leads to the mass deception of the public, shaping their beliefs and values without their awareness. Adorno and Horkheimer criticize the culture industry for its role in stifling individuality and promoting conformity through mass-produced entertainment and information. They warn against the dangers of a society controlled by the culture industry, where critical thinking is suppressed and manipulation is rampant. Adorno and Horkheimer's analysis sheds light on the hidden mechanisms of power in the modern world, exposing the ways in which the culture industry perpetuates mass deception and undermines the principles of enlightenment.
