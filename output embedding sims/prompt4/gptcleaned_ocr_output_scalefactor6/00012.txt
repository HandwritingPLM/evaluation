Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the system: langue and the individual speaking actor: parole. Langue is the set of conventions necessary for communication, regardless of the material of the signals that compose it, while parole is construed as the purely individual part of language (Derrida, 1977, p.13). Barthes extends Saussure's linguistic system into the social dimension. The system level, langue, is the social agreement of values shared within a society which is identified and accepted. In contrast, parole is the actual expression of the individual voice. Barthes considers speech relatively feeble due to the fact that language by an individual cannot be free from its shared conventions (Saussure, 1916).

Language is therefore, as a social institution and system of values, the personal aspect of language, it is conventionally a set of rules which one must adhere to in order to express oneself in communication. It is because language binds individuals within a society that it is considered a system of interdependent values (Barthes, 1977, pp.14-15).

On a schematic level, Saussure distinguishes that language is made up of two parts: the signifier is the sound image of a word and the signified is the concept that the signifier represents (Saussure).
