Like many other structuralist theorists, Barthes was influenced by linguistic theories. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels: the system of signs, the former called langue and the latter called parole. Langue is the structured system of communication, independent of the material of the signal it represents, while parole covers the act of individual speaking. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic theory in the social dimension. The structure level that serves the social common or shared understanding within society with its codified and standardized language. The social practice is noticeable because it is the active expression of the linguistic level. However, it considers relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual can be the only form of conversation - in which case, language.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the lived part of language. It asserts a subjective context in which one must stand in its entirety if one wishes to communicate effectively. It argues that a language carries an array of contracted meanings, but it also highlights that these meanings can change completely, depending on the source, variety, circumstance, dialect, and so on. Language is an indication well of guidance and actualization. The speaking subject uses the language with a view to expressing their personal thoughts. It asserts that speech plays a crucial role in forming individual and collective understanding and can also pose its own challenges (Barthes, 1957, p. 14-16).

Focusing on the symbolic nature of Saussure distinguishes the language between its two parts, the signifier and the signified. The signified is a concept or meaning that is expressed through the sign. The form is called the signifier, which is the real part of language. For example, in the word dog, the sound is expressing a concept, the actual animal, the concept in question. It suggests that a new term should be used to represent the whole and to replace signifier and signified, separate and isolate. For instance, "primary" rather than "subordinate"; this last term leads to seeing the advantage of distinction, the opposition and continuous relation of the two parts, and their inevitable interrelatedness, but the difference that their language does not create.

For sign's operating units, Barthes emphasizes, they are thus structured in a certain modular order. This includes the heads of possible signs that one can use in selecting the sign within the given paradigms for a complete system of signs. Barthes advises that the selections should be crucial in expressing both the meaningfulness and the play with the synthesis of both the combination of signs. They vary by either analogy in meaning or by what separates them. The perceiver is more active in generating meaning by associating different signs with each other, rather than simply observing them.
