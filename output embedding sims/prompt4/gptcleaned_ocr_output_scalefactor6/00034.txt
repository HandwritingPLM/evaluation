Uses and Gratifications

1.1 Introduction

The uses and gratifications approach is an influential trend in media research. The original inception of this approach was based on the research aimed at explaining the great appeal of mass media content. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1984). There are diverse ideas in this approach; audiences must know media content, and which media they can use to fulfill their needs.

In the mass communication process, the uses and gratifications approach places the function of linking needs, gratifications, and media choice squarely on the side of audience members. It suggests that people's needs influence what media they choose, how they use certain media, and what gratifications the media provide them. This approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users who are influenced by what kinds of media they use and assume audiences are heterogeneous, with diverse uses and gratifications. It is mainly concerned with what people do with media (Katz, Blumler, & Gurevitch, 1974). As traditional mass media and new media continue to offer a vast range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different media.

The approach emphasizes audiencesâ€™ choices by assessing their reasons for using media, in media to the disregard of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained that are based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin & Tankard, 1997). A broader perspective from communication theory provides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants select information and content effectively, aligned with their needs and interests (Katz, 1973). Audience members then incorporate the content into their messages and it is accepted that communication theories have evolved through the lenses of psychology and sociology over the past 10 years. With more unified fields in these two disciplines, researchers have developed higher conceptions and improved understanding of media.
