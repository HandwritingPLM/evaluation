Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1 Harold Lasswell (1907-1975)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, N.D).

1.2 Jacques Ellul (1912-1994)

Jacques Ellul was a French philosopher and sociologist. He focused on understanding the mechanics of propaganda.

Ellul can be credited with creating an emphasis on the technological aspect of propaganda, the fine art of persuasion through the use of symbols (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analyses can be defined as an investigation of communication messages by categorizing elements, analyzing certain variables, and identifying themes. Ellul's key idea was that certain symbols or signs have the power to shape public opinion. The integrity of the symbols used plays a crucial role in understanding the stream of influence that runs from content to audience.

This early content analysis is based on the systematic examination and organization of discourse from media sources regarding their persuasive intent.  It seeks to understand which channels and forms of appeal are most effective. Ellul's seminal work within the area of media and communication aims to offer a theoretical framework for understanding the role of media in shaping public opinion. He is particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in forming public opinion within a democratic system. In this regard, Lasswell has constructed a model, whereby the public is limited in the information presented to them and somewhat hesitant to accept it. However, it is crucial for the media to present a fair and unbiased view, taking into account the various opinions and making a genuine effort to inform and engage the public (Rogers, 1994).

1.3 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

Edward Bernays was a pioneer in the field of public relations. He was known for his groundbreaking work in the application of psychology to public relations. Bernays recognized that public opinion could be manipulated. He believed that the public could be influenced through the strategic manipulation of information, images, and emotions. He stated, "The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society." Based on this, he emphasized the need for a critical examination of media in creating public opinion, shaping beliefs, and influencing behavior.

These theorists have significantly contributed to the analysis and understanding of the impact of propaganda on public opinion and society as a whole. Their work continues to influence modern communication practices and shape how information is disseminated and received.
