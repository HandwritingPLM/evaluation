1. Early Influences

Therefore, the theorists pointed out that the uncertainty in this early process of public opinion polling was a barrier to the understanding of public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Encouragement of the early theorists played a huge role in increasing the engineering of consent.

Early Influences

Understanding of the public and the necessity of propaganda in influencing public opinion was reflected in the assumptions of Bernays and Lasswell.

Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied group dynamics and the influence of cognitive factors under the guidance of Kurt Lewin, a pioneer in the research of group dynamics and interpersonal communication. Festinger's work followed Lewin's theories and greatly influenced the developing field of group dynamics and the formation of Unimployment Benefit Theory (UBT).

Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider recognized the importance of cognitive dissonance which affected individuals' behaviors and interactions. He made significant contributions to the understanding of social psychology and communication in specific situations. Festinger acknowledged Lewin's significant influence and continued to develop his own theories based on his mentor's work.
