Since Benjamin never received a degree, the world allowed him search for a university, according to Adorno, Benjamin only pupil. After Benjamin's death, van Adorno "introduced a rational method into social philosophy." (Rogers, 2004, p. 456). The relationship with Benjamin greatly impacted the development of Adorno's thought during this time. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute. Adorno fought for his right to teach in September 1930 due to the rise of Nazism. Germany not only affected his political thinking but also influenced his philosophical ideas.
