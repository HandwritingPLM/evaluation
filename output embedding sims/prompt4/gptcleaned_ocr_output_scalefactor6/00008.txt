Sei it. Harold Lasswell played a key role in the development of social psychology, particularly in shaping the understanding of mass communication and the impact of propaganda on public opinion. He collaborated with a number of researchers including Knapp, Bernays, Lippmann, Ellul, and Taylor in exploring the cognitive approaches of news. Their work became popular along with that of Rogers and Piaget. Berger (2003) stated that the collaboration between Lasswell and other researchers was crucial in advancing the field of mass communication theory. The intersection of communication theory, social relationships, and cognitive processes has been acknowledged as a significant area for further research. Defining Uncertainty Uncertainty within communication theory has been a central concept, and there has been a focus on the role of uncertainty in information processing. Researchers like Shannon and Weaver, along with Rogers and Calabrese, contributed to the understanding and modeling of uncertainty within communication processes. Their work has provided valuable insights into how uncertainty affects decision-making and perception within interpersonal communication. Overall, the study of uncertainty and its implications in communication has become an essential element in understanding human interaction and decision-making.
