i. EARLY INFLUENCE

Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication. 

The theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to seduce.

Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication. 

The influence of their work can best be reflected in the essays of Berger and Calabrese (1974). 

1.00 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1944 he followed Lewin to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and in the development of UBT. Festinger is best known for his theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) aimed to explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect a perceived. Lewin first discussed CDT in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1957). CDT calls for three types of relationships with each other: a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other; a consonant relationship, in which the cognitions support each other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect. CDT explores the impact that cognitive dissonance, like uncertainty, has on individuals and the strategies they employ to reduce it. Social Comparison theory points out that individuals engage in social comparison to determine where they stand and may result in conformity processes. Berger and Cai also supported Festinger’s theories by stating that “Festinger was a pioneer in the analysis of discrepancies between experienced and desired states” (Berger & Cai, 1974, p.107). Festinger received the Distinguished Scientific Award of the American Psychological Association for his theoretical contributions to understanding cognitive dissonance. 

His theoretical insights have had a lasting influence, and in many cases, have shaped much of contemporary thinking, which emphasizes influences from his work (Kiefer, 1990). 

Writing earlier in this book, he states: “He has left a scientific heritage and writings that I use and derive directly from his work” (Hees, 1997, p. xx). 

He returned to academia, first at Smith College and later at the University of 

California, Berkeley in 1928. He later accepted a position at Yale University (Ash, 2000).
