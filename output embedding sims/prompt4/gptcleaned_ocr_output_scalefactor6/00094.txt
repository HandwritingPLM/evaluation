Needs and Gratifications

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows. They provide a framework for understanding the relationship between media and audiences:

1. The audience consists of active, i.e., an important part of the media process. Audience goals and patterns of media usage are shaped by more or less definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience.

2. In the mass communication process, the emphasis is on linking needs and gratifications and theorizing about any form of direct effect of media content on attitudes and behaviors.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs provided by the communication media build on a segment of the wider range of human needs and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media research can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - people are efficient enough to be able to report their needs and goals in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an understandable and familiar verbal form.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of media communication should be suspended while audience opinions are explored on their own terms (Katz et al., 1974, pp. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also emphasized that previous research on gratifications detected various preferences of people in the media, they did not address the connections between the gratifications. They outline seven aspects: the social and psychological origins of needs, perceptions of expectations of the mass media and other sources which lead to different experiences resulting in media production and other consequences, perhaps previously overlooked areas. The research by Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation for developing the needs and gratifications approach. Since then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and expanded. The current state of needs and gratifications is largely based on Katz's initial analysis, particularly as new media have emerged in an electronic information age where people have more options for media use.

Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the role of individual needs of media consumers. Katz et al. (1972) mentioned that people consume media for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media; on the contrary, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users. In terms of needs, social welfare, and individual background such as age, interests, and education, affect people's choices and how they benefit from the media. Therefore, diverse individuals can derive different satisfaction from using media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (2002) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to clarify how individual media gratification occurs.
