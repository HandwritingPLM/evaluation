Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1908. During the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, he worked on some family planning communication. The book has become a landmark textbook on diffusion theory and integrates a classification of application of diffusion theory in such fields as agriculture, communication, economics, psychology, political science, education, and, as previously mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2004 due to failing kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1962), diffusion refers to the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation is an idea, practice, or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels (p. 2). That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass media, people can get information about an innovation and perceive the innovation as useful. Linden (1948) presented a well-defined model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-F-R-E (e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1985) mentioned, "this S-M-C-R-E communication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion" (p. 19). Specifically, (1) senders can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be mass communication or word of mouth communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally, (5) the effects can be individuals' adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, time variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1983), this variable is involved in diffusion models, the innovation-decision process, innovativeness (differences), rate of adoption, and adopter categories. Diffusion theories have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion theory can be applied to a variety of contexts such as the overlap of innovation and communication, inter-personal influences in influencing commands for a installed an identity in a formal way. Also, change and improvement in social or business settings are of particularly interesting when adopting  (Lederer et al., 2000; Rogers, p. 1172).

Rogers defined five categories of adopters:
1) Innovators
2) Early adopters
3) Early majority
4) Late majority
5) Laggards
The categories are based on how high an individual is in adopting before others in their social system (Rogers, 2010, p. 219).

The patterns observed by innovativeness are over time and space where the faster a technology is perceived as a better choice, the faster it is adopted. There are several factors that need to be considered when thinking about diffusion over time and space, including the degree of refinement of an idea, organizational requirements and other mediating factors that can promote diffusion. Rogers (1983) mentioned that there are five main elements when an innovation is introduced:
1. Knowledge
2. Persuasion
3. Decision
4. Implementation
5. Confirmation

In summary, there are various methods for studying and evaluating the process through which an individual or unit takes on a new technology or practice.
