1. Weeds and Gratifications

The Weeds and Gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Conversely, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and what satisfies these needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interaction" that includes four important immediate gratifications: (1) Diversion – escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships – companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity – self-reference; reality exploration; wish fulfillment; and (4) Surveillance – forms of information seeking.

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active versus passive" initiation, "external versus internal goal orientation, and the matter stability of "growth and preservation". McGuire charted these factors to identify 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1 suggests a structure of 16 panel paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Riesz, Gurevich, and Hage (1979) developed 15 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of mass media and put them into three categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;
2. Affective needs, including amusement, pleasure, feelings;
3. Personal integration needs, including credibility, self-worth, status;
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Similarly, McGuire (1983) classified the following common reasons for media use:

- Finding out about recent events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world;
- Seeking advice on practical matters or making decisions;
- Satisfying curiosity and general interest;
- Learning and education;
- Gaining a sense of security through knowledge;
- Finding emotional or entertainment release;
- Finding models of behavior;
- Identifying with others (in the media);
- Gaining insight into oneself.
