Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition of media research. The original conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the gratifying appeal of certain media contents. The core question of mass research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1992) There exists a basic idea in this approach that people choose content, and which media they use to satisfy their needs.

This approach challenges what gratifications the media has provided instead of the traditional perspective that it assumes audiences are passive consumers of information. In contrast to traditional media research that focuses on "what media do to people" and assumes audiences are passive, the uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). This approach acknowledges that individuals choose to use media based on personal needs and responses to media content, which can vary based on their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates that people may use certain media for different purposes or needs, which can impact their media consumption behaviors.

The categories have evolved over time to address the diverse needs of individuals in consuming media content in various social contexts. The process of understanding media consumption is an important aspect of this discipline, recognizing the significance of engaging media.
