Uncertainty Reduction

Advances in Interpersonal Communication; Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorist

Since the twentieth century, the concept of information has been a major foundation for communication research with the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a key human function involving the sharing of ideas, goods, and information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. The reduction of uncertainty has been discussed as an essential aspect of communication. Through the development of URT, Berger and Calabrese (1972) recognized that reducing uncertainty was a central issue in communication. They advanced the field of interpersonal communication by focusing on the study of uncertainty. Heath and Heath (2000) stated, "One of the key underpinnings of interpersonal interaction is the question of information with which to reduce uncertainty" (p.3). The study of information is essential in all areas of communication, but it is especially important in understanding uncertainty in interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication at the center, which is a crucial step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Calabrese (1975) noted, "As communication researchers have turned their attention to interpersonal communication phenomena, they have begun to employ social psychological theories in understanding interactions." The research evaluating the theory and forms of interpersonal communication paved the way for interpersonal communication research to emerge with the development of URT, a crucial turning point in communication theories transitioning from conceptual approaches to practical applications.

1.20 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field. Interpersonal communication is most often associated with studies in language, cognition, and social interaction. Prior to the 1950s, only a modest amount of research was conducted under the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant (2000) identified this time as the beginning of the field of interpersonal communication: "Practically since 1901, scholars addressed communication as a central tenet because they recognized that it was both a scientific and an urgent area of importance" (p. 29). The research in the early periods influenced the development of an interdisciplinary approach in understanding personal and social relationships. Since then, communication patterns were not only influenced by social paradigms, but also by broader global trends in areas such as technology and media that shaped the idea that relationships could be interpreted through effective communication.
