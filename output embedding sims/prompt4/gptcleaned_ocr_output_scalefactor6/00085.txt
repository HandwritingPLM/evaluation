Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing public opinion (Bernays, 1988, p.1). Bernays (1988) makes a statement regarding his phrase, the engineering of consent He said, Engineering opinion-planning. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-era: it is not noise publicity and propoganda (Barneys, 1988, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays' theories also represent a different view of the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who saw the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass that can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p.68). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in attempting to influence the public, a business must carefully consider what terms the partnership can be to ensure it is amicable and mutually beneficial. It must see itself from the public's perspective, to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p.112).

Bernays elaborates on this: Mass in Public Relations (Bent, 1988) sees one can manipulate the public through openness. Bernays points out that turning information into a tool used across lines of the globe gives the public a desired portion. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bental, 1988, p. 4). Bernays' view of the public is even harsher than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of certainty. But still, he claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to see and evaluate the perspectives of others, to exercise leaders in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts being made by others, and to determine larger courses of action (p. 1). Under this framework, while the public is still pronounced, it is not so much nature ignorance of the public thinks. The artifice much as Lippmann and Ellul veered at this part.
