Like many other semiotician scholars, George was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. They distinguished mechanisms of ideas on what they characterize as parole and langue. Parole is the individual acts of speaking, while langue is the system of conventions necessary for communication, contrary to it speech (discourse that purely individualizes the code of language" (Burke, 1957, p.13). George interpreted Saussure's linguistic theories within the social dimension. The structure led George, Eve, to see the unity of language comprehension, in contrast to the individual acts. However, as the considered nature becomes the fact that each speech by an individual carries the shared contribution, the kinetic of a language is therefore a social institution and a conveyor of values. It is the social pursuit of a collective contest which can be found in the appropriation of a part of its form...On communication, George delineated a language as a system of contractual signs that mediates the communications coming from a single individual and consequently encourages a communitarian... to the cormication to language, which is both intentional and sensory. Language is essentially an individual act of selection and combination. The writing aspect comes from the pen and the signifier, that signify the concept or meaning which is expressed through the tongue. The semiotic features in English or in Kannada art discourse, by added printing. Here, the assumed, well, form is established to the signifier. It is proper to realize the intended tends to signify the whole and to replace the concept and sound-image pieces by swords (signifier) and image. As George has it, George has a certain advantage of indicating the opposition that exists other from each other and from the whole of which every part (Sausurre, 1959). The correspondence of the concept signifying corresponding to the external world has been perceived as not in total actuality. George, however, confers, the signs that comprises the signifying system. Saussure (1959) asserts that language does not reflect a priori and current reality or an independent conflicts. He constructs meaning from within, through a series of conceptual and phonetic differences. According to Saussure, “meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of primary words...like synechism (e.g.,...single event that organized subfield of signifying event” (Harker, 2002, p. 23). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlining systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a set of possible signs that can be substituted with one another. Careful watch perceiver in selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, such as the selection that is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, let’s consider the following sentence: “I went to the theater with my girlfriend." The set here shows the rear combination of signs. The signs within this example, such as theater, my, and girlfriend can be substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as “she went to a restaurant with her assistant." Through the syntagmatic and paradigmatic, Sausurre tells us that signs are operable only when they are related to each other. Crucially, senses do not reside by virtue of reference in an independent objective world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each other. Thus, meaning is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs (Hall, 2002, p. 23). It can be contended to Saussure's argument that red is meaningful in relation...between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are them specialized into numerous meanings derived from their differences.
