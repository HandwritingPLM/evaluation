Like many other structuralists such as Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics, by seeing language as speaking actors. The former emphasizes on certain laws, systematic system, and the variation. According to Barthes and Saussure, structuralistically, the linguistic system not only operates within the social context but also within the social convention or values created and maintained by society. Hence, language as a social institution carries a system of values. The social part of language is closely related to social values which are accepted within society and necessary for communication. By becoming acquainted with these various systems of codes, the speaking subject can understand the complexity and diversity within language. Depending on the developmental stage, Saussure's theory of the signifier and signified, the engagement of the concept of meaning, is crucial in deciphering the coded language. The word 'dog' in English or in any other language are the specific forms representing the actual visual object. This can be understood through the associated mental representations derived from the connection between the words and the actual objects they represent. Barthes's theory regarding the connoted meaning of signs shows the dual nature of language and how it is perceived. Understanding the concept of signs and their different meanings is a fundamental aspect of seizing the deeper layers of language and communication.
