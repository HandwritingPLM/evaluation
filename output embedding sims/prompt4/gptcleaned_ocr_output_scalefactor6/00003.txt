1 EARLY INFLUENCES

Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication. The following theorists explore how communicating can be a vehicle for individuals unlike to reduce uncertainty.

1.1 Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication. The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Chicago under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Iowa, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Sumelson, 2004). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and in the development of LRT. Festinger is best known for the theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Festinger studied CDT in observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other, a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in conflict with each other, and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another (West & Turner, 2008). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of averseness and dissonance that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory posits that individuals look to feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To assess the self, the individual seeks the opinions of others who are similar to themselves. This need for social comparison underlies many interpersonal processes (Tesser & Lee, 28). Berger and Calabrese (1975) extended social comparison to LRT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others who are proximal when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of their behavior or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's legacy is significant, and his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aaronson and Festinger (1980) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of cognitive dissonance, and its open problem can be clearly seen even today” (p. 7).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider was a prominent figure in the field of interpersonal relationships. Heider paid tribute to Lewin, describing him as a substantial presence in his life "I wish only to pay tribute to Lewin's stimulating influences, which have affected much of my thinking and which are still bearing fruit in. This book, although it does not derive directly from his work" (Heider, 1954, p. viii). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Swarthmore College and later at the University of Kansas, where he worked for the remainder of his career.
