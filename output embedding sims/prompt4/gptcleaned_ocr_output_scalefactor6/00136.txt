Narratives Carmel, Reverie in 1931, started his career in BLA, MAL, and PH2 degrees free (Rogers said). In fact, for years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force in planning communication projects in Korea. One of the proponents of diffusion theory and its practical applications for marketing, political science, and other areas.

Bernie Hilton: Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2X because he was suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 1, 20%.

According to Rogers (Hag), diffusion refers to the spread of ideas (via channels) over time among the members of a social system, where the practices, objects, or objectives are perceived as acceptable by an individual or other members of adoption. The rate of innovation involves both mass media and interpersonal communication. Rogers (1946) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, B-H-C-R-E fig. Under media channels interaction. Rogers (195) mentioned, "The 3-M-C-BrB communication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion" (p. 12). Specifically, (1) sender can be innovators or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a germ idea or product, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally (5) the effects can be individual adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, "Time variables can differ in the interaction process: (1) innovativeness; (2) an innovation's rate of spread. Most innovations have an S-shaped curve of adoptions. Numerous research has aimed to explain the variables that influence how and why an audience adopts new communication tools, such as the Internet. Other factors like individual influence and support also play a significant role in the adoption of new technology. Therefore, interpersonal influence and support are crucial for the overall success of new innovative ideas.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Rogers: (1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional) (Rogers, 13. pp, 1-185). Rogers defined this term as "the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other people, divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Participants follow a standardized diffusion curve which is bell-shaped. Some research suggests that innovations would spread through society over various periods of time in an S-shaped course. However, as noted above, different populations (e.g., the rate of early adoption is faster than that of the hybrid academic) can have their own different rates of diffusion. Figure 2 shows that innovations would spread through society over various periods of time in an S-shaped course. In the process of innovation decisions, Rogers (195) mentioned that:

1. Knowledge + or â€” (subjective exposure of awareness of news

2. Attitudes + 09 = (people have positive or negative attitudes toward innovation)

3. Adopting Decision: people decide to adopt the innovation

4. Implementing (regular or standard practice)

5. Confirmation (comparing and evaluating)
