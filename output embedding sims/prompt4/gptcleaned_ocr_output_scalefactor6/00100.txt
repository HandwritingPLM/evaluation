Foogers was born in Carall, Iowa in 1931. He earned his A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the US Air Force. Interestingly, in 1968, he worked on some military planning communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and its application in various fields such as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 1999 due to suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1995), diffusion refers to the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation or idea is perceived as new by an individual or group before adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels. Rogers (1995) mentioned, "this 5-Mil-R-E scheme corresponds closely to the elements of GAS" (p. 195). Specifically, (1) senders can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) messages can be new ideas or products, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally, (5) the effect can be adoption or rejection. In his diffusion theory, "Time" is an important factor. According to Rogers (1992), the five key elements in diffusion are (1) the innovation-decision process: (2) innovativeness: (3) an innovation's rate of adoption. Much research has been done on S-shaped curves of adoption. This curve represents how and why individuals or groups adopt or reject innovations. Also, some innovations spread faster than others depending on factors like the medium used for communication, the influence of early adopters, and the perceived benefits of adoption.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Rogers (1995): (1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (deliberate), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional). Rogers defined this term as "the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other members of his social system" (Rogers, 1995, p. 400). Figure 1 shows the relationship between types of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Additionally, these categories follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by www.readyred/deci shows the diffusion figure. Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods in an S-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations (e.g., the rate of tetracycline adoption is faster than that of the hybrid corn) can have their own different rates of diffusion.

1. Knowledge + of - (selective exposure or awareness of news)

2. Attitudes + or - (people have positive or negative attitudes towards innovations)

3. Adoption (Decision making people decide to adopt the innovation)

4. Implementation (regular or standardized practice)

5. Confirmation (comparing and evaluating)
