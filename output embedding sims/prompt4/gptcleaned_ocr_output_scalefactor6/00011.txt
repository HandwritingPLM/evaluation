Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1956) himself made a statement regarding his phrase, the engineering of consent public opinion. He stated, Engineering is here made a statement regarding his private than anything about their manipulation for gaining, And it is careful planning more propaganda (Bernays, 1956, p.22). Initially, his argument that may examine and manipulate the opinions of the public. In operation certainly sees some entities instead, the public is being entirely governed by one means or another, which is not an accurate representation of the truth (Bernays, 1903, p.56). Instead, Herman (1992) argued that the key to being successful is a mutual understanding of the public, as business and society can each benefit from a partnership based on common goals and mutual benefit. It is apparent that in order to achieve this, the aims, objectives, and actions need to be clearly articulated and the partnership can be facilitated by terms which are practical. This was shown by the collaboration of the Skinner-Rogers (1981). Both have expedited the public to remain informed on information pertaining to public policy. It is necessary to cater to the idea of the public and the upward communication process to aid change in certain societal aspects for the better. Seduction can also be achieved by the use of propaganda that aims to control the idea of the public and the masses. The effort will soon expire - otherwise, an alteration in contemporary society for the better is the pull towards achieving this objective (Bernays, 1922, p.9). Bernays's view of the public is different than that of Lippmann's, but it can be argued that certainty and the manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays's comprehended the significance of public relations; To coordinate in general, public relations are important because it helped them to orchestrate the mechanism of which we are all a part. Moreover, it evaluates the viewpoints of others and their leaders contributing to a conditioning consensus that overpowers us, by evaluating different pathways taken to achieve a goal in a collective effort or the pursuit of engaging in different paths of action (p.30). Greater than heretofore, this manipulation of the public implied power. However, it is not in such blatant ignorance of these probable spikes presented by Lippmann and Ellul that others resorted in dealing precisely with the people.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are valuable for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, appreciates now play a key role in his address to the public. Throughout the technique of these theories, it has become influenced by their guidance. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues had set the pace for recent pioneering research and the assurance that is nowadays understood thanks to the explorations of the public and the public. Through the efforts made by Bernays and others, the analysis of the media has been further developed. The public has now been well served under many conditions changing, such as news, campaigns, and public opinion that Bernays has caught on their ways. The authors emerged in their narratives including concepts such as Ellul observed to only pursue the',
by any means, any policy, and the exertion of the committee that explicitly made to influence the: examining the viewpoints of the masses alike. Additionally, theorists such as Lippmann and Rogers provided significant contributions to the better understanding of the society that we live in today.
