1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese, and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Berger and Calabrese affirmed the core of information flow to be a strong foundation in the area of Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT). Informed exchange is a basic premise for initiating interpersonal interactions in which individuals seek, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT), developed by Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), suggests that reducing uncertainty is a central objective of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars advanced the field of interpersonal communication by emphasizing its significant role in uncertainty reduction. Berger and Calabrese (1975) note that "One of the motivations underlying interpersonal communication is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty" (p.159). The lack of information is fundamental to all modes of communication, yet in relation to the study of uncertainty in particular, advanced theoretical approaches in the field of interpersonal communication are crucial. URT plays a pivotal role in enhancing communication processes that were previously underdeveloped in the field of interpersonal communication. Both Berger and Calabrese (1975) state that "When communicators have conducted prior research on the interpersonal communication process, they have benefitted by gaining a deeper understanding of interpersonal communication processes" (p.5). The research underlying this theory and the efforts made by contemporary scholars have marked the emergence of a new era in understanding interpersonal communication research. The impact of URT on communication research has been significant. The research conducted in this area has contributed to the development of new insights and theoretical advancements in the field of interpersonal communication. Traditional communication paradigms have been reevaluated, and an interdisciplinary focus on interpersonal communication has emerged. Over the years, research conducted under the umbrella of interpersonal communication has expanded to include diverse areas such as linguistics, sociology, organization theory, and psychology. Since the 1980s, communication scholars have recognized the central importance of URT in understanding and addressing the complexities and challenges of human interactions. The research conducted in this area has contributed to a better understanding of the intricacies of interpersonal relations, social dynamics, and psychological processes that are inherent in human communication.
