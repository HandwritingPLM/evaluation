CULTURE (Minar

Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

Bache et al. discuss the power of The Song in order to understand the creation of the “iron cage of the future” (Weber, 1930, p. 1). The idea of the TNS Fore was a critical topic in the philosophy of Adorno. He argued that there are coalitions, groups, within culture serving as a way to influence public opinion (Adorno, 1968). Adorno also highlighted the role of culture in manipulating the masses through a mechanical reproduction of art and entertainment (Adorno, 1968). 

The relationship between Adorno and Benjamin led to the transformation of Adorno’s ideas into academic philosophy (Rogers, 2014). This development influenced the work of Adorno as he further explored the relationship between culture and society in the Institute of Social Research (Adorno, 2014). Adorno's collaboration with Lorkbeimer also played a crucial role in promoting critical theory (Adorno, 2014).

The work of Adorno and Benjamin contributed to a new understanding of mechanical reproduction and its impact on the authenticity of art (Adorno & Benjamin, 1950). While Benjamin emphasized the loss of aura through reproduction, Adorno highlighted the importance of preserving the authenticity of cultural artefacts (Adorno & Horkheimer, 1950). 

In contrast to Adorno, Marcuse focused on the potential of radio in disseminating culture and promoting critical thinking among the masses (Marcuse, 1964). Marcuse’s work with the Princeton Radio Research Project reflected his belief in the power of media to influence public opinion (Marcuse, 1964). 

Overall, the collaboration between Adorno, Benjamin, and Marcuse exemplified the importance of critical theory in understanding the relationship between culture and society (Rogers, 2014). Their collective work laid the foundation for future research in the field of cultural studies.
