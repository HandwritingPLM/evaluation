i. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1. Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumer and Katz (1974) concluded that different See 2 he Ee Gave Generation Mes
Tage for very different purposes. The same media content may grant different needs for different
audiences. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people’s ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
interests. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications
for using different media. Blumler and Brown (1974) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions'' to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self-referent; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information
seeking).

Another subdivision related to the audience's motivation was suggested by Perse (1974), based

on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" orientation, "external versus
internal" goal orientation, and orientation stability of "growth" and "preservation." When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1. Figure 0. 4
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motive (McGuire, 1972). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas
(1979) developed 25 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into three broad categories:

- Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding.
- Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings.
- Personal integrative needs, including credibility and social ties.
- Societal integrative needs, including developing relationships with family and friends, and
- Tension release needs including escape or stress relief.
