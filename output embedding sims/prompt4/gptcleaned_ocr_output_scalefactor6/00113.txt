1. Needs and Gratifications

The uses and gratifications approach emphasizes a perspective that media content may satisfy various needs of individuals. Different people turn to media for different purposes. The same media content can gratify different individuals partially based on their needs. There is not only one way that people use media but there are multiple reasons for using it, based on individual needs, social situations, and the individual's background such as experience, interests, education, and affect people's ideas about what they want from media and what media can serve. Audience members are aware of and can articulate their motivations for using different media. McClelland, Burnham, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important reception motives: 1) Diversions (escape, relaxation, entertainment), 2) Personal relationships (companionship, social utility), 3) Personal identity (self-reference, reality exploration, value reinforcement), and 4) Surveillance (news and information seeking). Another detailed version of the audience motivation was suggested by McQuail (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective, along with three dimensions: "active" vs "passive" initiation, "external" vs "internal" goal orientation, and orientation stability of "growth" and "preservation." When combined, these factors yield 26 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A restructuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuinn, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1972) developed 35 needs derived from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and P. Roberts Charles Travis Cove the
