1. Return to Germany

are published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested this as the publication of their own work in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the end, the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and was opened in its new premises in 1961. Horkheimer became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay entitled 'How to Look at Television' that was the result of a study that had been done for the Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay, Adorno warned that rapid industrialization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed-of psychological control (Adorno, 1954, p. 12). There was one of the few occasions in the 1950s that Adorno was able to see the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it strange that the leading cultural theorist of the day did not take part in cultural developments of the fifties (Jaeger, 1983, p. 101). Adorno would sometimes even consider attempting to reshape his thoughts on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture in the United States (Adorno, 1959, p. 20), and gave a public talk in Germany in 1961 on 'The Culture Industry Reconsidered.' In 1956, when writing the essay 'Transparencies on Film,' Adorno conceded that filmmaking might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the boundaries of modernism (Herberle, 1956, p. 131).

2. One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse: For an analysis of late capitalist society in a systematically controlled, as opposed to other writers of the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 66). Instead of cultural cultivating ecological ethics, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society was the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Feltz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist reduction and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it produced a system of repressive tolerance that stifled and quieted the best elements of society (Marcuse, 1965, p. 86). The entirety of society had become organized around an ideology where its main objectives were in fulfilling social control and manipulation to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control. 

Daring Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the sphere of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulative and entrapping influence (Marcuse, 1968, p. 89). Moreover, it was difficult to balance arguments between supporters of the culture industry and those who saw culture as separate from society as a whole: because Marcuse did not distinguish culture as separate from personal marks and cultural developments in the same way that Adorno had done. The divergent focuses of these aspects of society allowed for differing interpretations to emerge. Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individuals be made aware of their constraints and transcended, and the repressive mechanisms of the administered existence be overcome?" (Marcuse, 1964, p. 361). This was a realization that over time, both in the U.S. and Germany, developed an oppositional stance, yet, Marcuse reiterated that he was a philosopher, not an activist. Like pure theory, writing required much revision in order to receive this essay's publication in the Fischer publishing house and elsewhere. The work since then has been recognized as a significant contribution to philosophy and entertainment aspects.
