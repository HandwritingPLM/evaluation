Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

In the search for explaining the great appeal of media, a core question of such research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1983). There rests a basic idea in this approach that people select media content which they can use to meet their needs. In the communication process, the uses and gratifications approach puts the function of linking need gratification and media choice squarely on the side of audience members. It suggests that peopleâ€™s needs influence what media they would choose, how they use certain media, and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active participants in the use of media as opposed to passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus on "what media do to people" and assume audiences are homogeneous, the uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). It relates audiences' personal needs to how they use media and responds to the media, which is determined by their social and psychological background. The uses and gratifications approach also points out that the media compete with other information sources for audiences' highest satisfaction (Katz et al., 1974). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different media. The approach emphasizes audiences' choice by assessing their reasons for choosing certain media over others, as well as the various gratifications they derive from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin & Tankard, 1997). As a broader perspective among media theories, it provides a framework for understanding the processes by which audiences select and consume media content effectively. This can aid in their personal development and satisfaction (Roary & Nabila, 2022).

1.2 Origin and History

Media theories have developed through decades of study and research. With input from valuable theories as well as groundbreaking research, it is well accepted that communication intersects with the fields of psychology and sociology, exploring more nuanced facets in these disciplines. Researchers have guided an advancement in understanding media effects, paving the way for audience members to incorporate the gained knowledge to satisfy their interests (Lowery & Nabila, 2022).
