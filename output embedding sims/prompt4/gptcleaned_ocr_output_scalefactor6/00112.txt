Defining Uncertainty

Research conducted under the tele of interpersonal communication initially focused on parenes, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of beaming, dissonance, and - ance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2006). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of scholars such as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the century and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson. Fees (2005) state: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda over the past several decades.” Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyad communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on those pioneers who pioneered the measurement of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is central in our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Uncertainty has been identified as an important constituent, necessary for the study of communication. It took a mathematical view and here it has been defined and studied. One way of consolidating these views is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter aims to define the theory of uncertainty as relating to interpersonal communication. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts like Heider (1998) research in attribution, Further; By defining the function of uncertainty in relationship dynamics in communication. During interactions, individuals are new enga faced with uncertainty. Predicting future actions based on past behaviors can be challenging. According to Perdue and Gurtman (1990), certainty is obtained when there is no variability in interpersonal experiences. The levels of communication can vary, but it may ultimately lead to the establishment of normalcy and predictability, which helps in maintaining relationships and coherence.
