The core of public opinion. Oppose to Lippmann, who views the public as being manipulated, Bernays disagrees. He states, "The public is not as dumb as one might think" (Bernays, 1928, p.16). Therefore, in attempting to influence public opinion, the theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are needed. While the public may not be as easily influenced as some would believe, the manipulation can be more subtle and effective. The role of propaganda in shaping public opinion, in fact, has been recognized as crucial by leaders through history. Propaganda has been used to warp the truth and distort reality, leading people to believe in a version of events that may not be accurate. Therefore, it is important to recognize the power of propaganda and the necessity of understanding how it works to avoid being manipulated.

Understanding the way in which information is disseminated helps individuals to be aware of potential manipulation and make more informed decisions. By recognizing the impact that these theories have on society, we can better appreciate the role they play in shaping our beliefs and attitudes.
