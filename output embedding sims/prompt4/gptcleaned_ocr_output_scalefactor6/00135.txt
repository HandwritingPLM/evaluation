DEPICTING UNCERTAINTY

Kelley, and Howland. By the 1970s, Teena Interviews began to be conducted according to the document, and released] content. This was influenced by the research at Knapp, Mehrabian, Watzlawick, Duck, Kelley, and Thayer. During the later part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Manusov, Roloff, and Berger became popular. Along with research on interaction and communication adaptation by Gaito, and Pearson.
Berger (1960) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal relational communication agenda during the past few decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal COMMUNICATION has a focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, and a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1950s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on the theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in Communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to examine when the concept originated, and how it has been defined in theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty arises from a given situation when there is a high amount of possible alternatives and the probabilities of their occurrence are equally shown in uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of WRT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the information theories, as well as Helgeson (1958) research in attribution, Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded the concept of uncertainty to interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the “the number of alternative ways in which each person might behave” (p. 60). The greater the breadth of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behavior and occurrences. During interactions, individuals are not only faced with predictions of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners believe or behave in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially do” (uncertainty plays a significant role when examining relational relationships). High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty = 200, Incompetent Communicators may not be able to develop relationships or sustain. Teenagers in initial interactions. West gulf Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty are associated with increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of immediacy, and increased liking, thus there is a significant predictability with the goal that this will lead to better predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty exists, it is difficult to reach this goal. Although individuals feel less secure and are not often able to predictability can also inhibit a relationship. Heath and Errnjar also present views of certainty and predictability can damage a relationship as they state: “Too much certainty".
