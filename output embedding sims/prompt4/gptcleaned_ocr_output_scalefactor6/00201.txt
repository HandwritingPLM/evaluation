1, THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Furthermore, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adorno's experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jaeger, 1990, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting: the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop his critique of the culture industry.

One of the relationships within the Institute for Social Research was between Horkheimer, who had already resided part-time in America since November 1938, and included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Bertolt Brecht, several of which found work in the film industry upon relocating to California and West Hollywood. Adorno's interest in music was also evident in his collaboration with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with Hollywood film industry.

His concern for the loss of high art, as opposed to popular culture, in contemporary society was a centrall theme in his critique of the culture industry.
