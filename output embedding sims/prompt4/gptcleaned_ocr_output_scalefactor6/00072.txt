Defining Uncertainty

Research conducted under the field of interpersonal communication initially focused on social influence, and small group practices. Theorists explored the role of behavior, appearance, social judgment, and acceptance (Barger, 1975). Kurt Lewin, a founder of social psychology, emphasized development and relational control. This was influenced by the research of scholars such as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the latter part of the 20th century, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Penale, Roloff, and Berger, along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Hargie, and Harsono. Berger (2006) notes "these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication agenda during the past few decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication continues to focus on dyadic communication, face-to-face interaction, and the function of developing relationships. Research in interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major area of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter aims to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is essential for understanding interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty
Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there were high amounts of possible alternatives and the probabilities of their occurrence were relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of uncertainty reduction theory. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adapted concepts from information theory as well as Heider's (1958) research on attribution. Berger and Calabrese expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining it as "the extent of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 99). The greater the uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict outcomes and consequences. During interaction, individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe the way they do. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlights this complexity when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of interpretations that a stranger can have of potentially wary behavior." Uncertainty plays a vital role in relationships. Higher levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit social relations when examining areas of ambiguity which commonly lead to difficulties in four types of communication concerns.
