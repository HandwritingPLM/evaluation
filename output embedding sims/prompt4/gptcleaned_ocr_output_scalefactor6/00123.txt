1. Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and perceived needs of audience members. Gunter and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content can gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Gunter & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual’s background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people’s ideas about what they want from the media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are unique and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumer, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivision of the larger concept of motivation was developed by Pelto et al. (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. They distinguished between two types of “needs: cognitive and affective. Then they added three dimensions: achievement versus passive orientation, external versus internal locus orientation, and emotional stability for “growth” and “preservation” motives. These factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to our figure – such a structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Osgood and Bales (1953) developed 35 memes taken from the social and psychological functions of the media and grouped them into five categories:

Cognitive needs, including information, education, knowledge, and understanding.
Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, satisfaction, and liking.
Personal integrative needs, such as credibility, stability, and personal growth.
Social integrative needs, including integration, social interaction, influence, and social contact.
Tension release-based needs, including escape and diversion, tension reduction, and catharsis.
The recognition and satisfaction of the above needs can lead to the fulfillment of:
Self-esteem needs, such as status, recognition, and self-respect.
Security needs, including privacy and personal security.
Social belonging needs, such as association and group affiliation.
Self-actualization needs, such as personal growth, self-fulfillment, and realizing one's full potential.

These findings shed light on the diverse and complex nature of human motivation and behavior.
