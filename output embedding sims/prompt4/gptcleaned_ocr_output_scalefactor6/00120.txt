L. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists
L. Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking critical analyses of it. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was either written or inspired by the work of Lippmann himself (Rogers). Lasswell was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both qualitative and quantitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the concept of propaganda, and discovering the effects of propaganda on the audience (Rogers). Lasswell is credited with creating the most common communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers). Generally, content analyses can be defined as "the systematic recording of communication content in order to classify variables" (Rogers). In his essay "The Structure and Function of Communication," Lasswell explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols attempt to influence the audience's opinion, and the intensity of the responses needed. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell aids in achieving the goal of understanding the "chain of influence that extends from one propagandist to another and from propagandist to audience" (p. 74).

This method of content analysis has led strongly to Lasswell's stated definition of communication, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 6). Content analysis can be directly related to the work of Lasswell, as he stressed that "it is the way in which information is used that can affect the decay of culture" (Rogers). However, the confusion they face in affecting their concepts within the democratic system, and its being presented as theory, may be greater than intended. This can be an interesting way of viewing the prevalence of the idea that in certain situations, Lippmann's theories are similar (Rogers).

2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were forming public opinion and propaganda, Edward Bernays was earning a name for himself in public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Beyond that, he delved into the concept of creating a form of consensus to influence the minds and actions of the public by creating an idea, any group (Rogers). As in other propaganda theorists, Bernays explains that he can be best perceived as steering public opinion along a certain path in order to show or alter the opinions of individuals, which are actively beneficial in seeking shared beliefs among everybody. Bernays writes, "A person...is preferred, largely by agreement, rather than by pressure or force. Rather than a better kind of propaganda is the secret council of a voice of many people expressing emphatically as a social functioning orchestra" (p. 10). 

Can anyone who shares the idea that public opinion can be guided also agree that other propaganda methods may be just as impactful in reaching the public to change to a higher standard for each life, regardless of their background or beliefs" (Bernays).

In any case, they form a remarkable foundation for influencing the public by placing the key to coordinated, lasting relations in society, gathering interpretations and enhancing persuasion methods to reform the public opinion in the expected directions. In view of this, one could say that they form the core of a strategic prevention plan for a greater acceptance of the principles of good governance - stocking up requirements of far greater importance in society, enhancing interpretations, uniting perspectives, and realizing opportunities for action. What they aim for is a quality presentation of "the art of propaganda and nerve-racking oysters.
