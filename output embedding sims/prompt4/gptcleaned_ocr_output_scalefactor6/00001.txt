OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

Other Propaganda Theorists
L.A Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the components of propaganda, and investigating the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1944). Lasswell is credited with creating "The mass communication procedure of dominant absence" (Rogers, 1944). Generally, content analysis can be defined as, "the investigation of communication content by categorizing research items into classifications for in-depth analysis in order to ascertain certain facts" (Rogers, 1958). In one acknowledged "Commentary of Communications and Psychology," Lasswell (1945) outlined the four conjectures one should take into account: the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a media, the directions in which the symbols lead the audience, and the congruity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1945) achieves the goal of understanding the "sources of influence that arise from communicated symbols cued to an audience" (p. 74).

Three core concepts noted strongly by Lasswell (1952) early defined communication which included, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effect." Content analysis has many facets that are part of the framework, and Lasswell ever did work within this area during his career.

Apart from creating public opinion within the public information center, another consideration that is affecting their decisions is mainly democratic values. Lasswell's thesis is an evaluation of the power of the media that has been acknowledged since Lippmann's theories.

Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

An approach that reveals that Edward Bernays (1891-1995) is widely regarded as a pioneer who desires to apply the principles of psychology to public relations, marketing, corporate image, and political communication. Arguably, that a company can be substantially more beneficial if it relies on more than the perception of individuals. Bernays says, "We are governed, our minds molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of." With the power of persuasion, Bernays claims to engineer public consent to the reality of modern democracy, advertising agencies or the heavily funded propaganda of the war, assembling, organizing, and presenting his public image to be more than what it really is.

Bold efforts to pursue honest communication show that they are an organization that has a soul, one that has inner faith and not a breadwinner of public opinion. They are always eager to communicate facts and the most basic truth about the rarity of rare products or rebuild the porkpie and say, "This is a divine product.‚Äù By communicating well, they revolutionize the earnings of conscience actions such as those that influence public opinions that are in-depth. They summarize one of the inside stories: "Clearly the popular press and the written word of rare products can be openly determinant but bows to appearances." And for the general good.
