Needs and Gratifications

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows:

Key points for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

The audience is not passive, but active. Media usage is not only influenced by what is being offered but also by the specific expectations of what certain types of content have to offer the audience member.

In the mass communication process, the initiative and decision-making power lie with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on theorizing about any direct cause-and-effect relationship of media content on audiences.

The interconnectedness with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs fulfilled by communication contribute to a subset of the broader context of human needs, and the extent to which they are met can vary considerably.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media can be derived from data provided by individual audience members themselves. People are self-aware enough to recognize their own interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to acknowledge them when presented with them in a clear and familiar verbal form.

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be based on audience orientations explored on their own terms. (pp. 15-17)

Additionally, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also conducted previous research on gratifications, identifying diverse gratifications that attract people to the media. They noted interactions between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974). They suggested that needs and gratifications research should focus on the following aspects: (1) the social and psychological origins of needs, (2) expectations generated by needs for mass media or other sources resulting in (3) varying exposure (or engagement in other activities), leading to (4) gratification of needs and (5) other consequences, possibly including unintended ones (Katz et al., 1974, p. 20). The work of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation for expanding the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, research on this subject has continued to evolve. The analysis of uses and gratifications remains relevant, particularly as new media forms have emerged in the electronic information age, providing more options for engagement.

Needs and Gratifications

The uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived roles of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different individuals can utilize the same media message for different purposes. The same media content may satisfy different needs for different individuals. There is not just one way that people use media. Conversely, there are as many reasons for media use as there are users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Various factors, such as need, social situation, and individual background, influence why people choose and use different media. Media use and needs can be better understood by examining why and how individuals select and consume certain media, including the order of preference for various media sources.
