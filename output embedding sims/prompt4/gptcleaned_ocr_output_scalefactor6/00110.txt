Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that the public can be influenced by outside sources. He emphasized the need to understand the influence of media on the public. Through the work of Lippmann and later researchers, a more comprehensive understanding of public opinion has been developed. The public has access to numerous media platforms such as television, radio, and the internet that have the potential to influence public opinion.

The theories presented in this paper are tied heavily to both the direct effects and indirect effects of propaganda could have on the mind of the audience. While the theories of Lippmann are novel in the idea that the media might be influencing public thought, many could be influenced by what people see and hear. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a foundation for future political theory by scholars such as Weber, as well as McCombs and Shaw. The research of these scholars is very important in the understanding of the media, the government's influence, and the formation of public opinions. While the views of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul may seem complex, they all contribute to a more well-rounded understanding of how media influences the public.
