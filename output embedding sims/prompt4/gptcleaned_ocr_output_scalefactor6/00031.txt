bark Gromber and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication means
for very different purposes. The same media content may be differently sought by different
individuals. There is not a one map that people use media. Contrary, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumberg & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and individual’s background, such as experience, interests, and
education, are people’s cues of what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their preferences and gratifications
for using different media. Palmquist, Boucher, and Brewer (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
stress; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self-enrichment; credibility confirmation; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information-
seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience motivation was suggested by Mosher (1974) based
on a personal theory of human needs. He distinguished between basic clusters of needs and
affects. Then he added three dimensions: “active versus passive” motion, “external versus
internal” goal orientation, and emotional stability of “growth” and “maintenance.” When combined,
these choices yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1. Figure 1A shows
examples of 16 psychological paradigms of human motivation (Bietz, 1974). Berelson, Gaudet and Hane
(1978) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and

put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and such research.

2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings.

3. Personal integrative needs, associating credibility of a valuable source.

4. Social integrative needs, including interacting more often with friends and family; and

5. Tension relief needs, including a state of going somewhere else.

According to McQuail’s (1967) classification of the following common reasons for need gratification:

finding out about relevant events and current affairs in media coverage, thereby also satisfying a need for practical information, opinion and decision choices
satisfying curiosity and general interest
entertaining; seeking a sense of security through knowledge;
directing relaxation, entertainment for pleasurable hours
changing models of behavior
identifying with valued others in the media
getting a clearer insight into personalities
