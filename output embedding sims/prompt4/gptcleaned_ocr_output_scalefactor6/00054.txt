Defining Uncertainty

Research conducted under the labels of interpersonal and cognitive dissonance, social influence, and small group processes. Theories of social psychology, acceptance, judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Key research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, played a significant role in influencing a range of social interactions, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the latter part of the decade as Knapp, Motirabian, Alias, Taylor, Dock, Kelley, and Thibaut, as Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation and communication research. Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the direction trends have taken in communication during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication, focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication shows that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reductions (Berger). The study that has since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major factor that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter surveys those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Seeing that is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central to understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there were a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the information theorists as well as Heider (1950) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behavior, but also explaining why parties behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1962) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say." Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can cause stress and anxiety which can lead to lower levels of communicator competence (West & Turner, 2000). Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or may be too anxious to engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty caused increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking. In interactions individuals are expected to increase predictability with the ability to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. When certainty exists, more peace emerges and a few barriers will dissipate afeay can a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “Too much uncertainty and unpredictability can deaden a relationship."
