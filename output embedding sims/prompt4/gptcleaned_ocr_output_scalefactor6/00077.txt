Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

The Uses and Gratifications approach is an influential conception of how people use media and certain media contents. The core question of this approach is why people use them (McQuail, 1982). These needs influence what media they choose to consume, and what gratifications they seek from the media. This approach differs from other theoretical perspectives as it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media studies that focus on "what media do to people" and assume audiences are homogeneous, the Uses and Gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1974). It focuses on audiences' personal needs and how they use media, taking into account their social and psychological background. The approach also suggests that the media competes with other information sources for audience satisfaction (Reitz et al., 1974). As traditional mass media and new media provide a wide range of platforms and content, this perspective is considered one of the most appropriate for investigating why audiences choose to engage with different media. The approach emphasizes audiences' choices by assessing their reasons for using certain media over others, as well as the gratifications obtained based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin & Tankard, 1997). From a broader perspective of Communication Research, it provides a framework for understanding how media participants seek information, engage with content, and fulfill their needs and interests (Katz et al., 1974). Audience members incorporate media to fulfill their needs or satisfy their interests.

1.2 Origin and History

It is well-accepted that communication theories have developed through the exploration of more unified fields in these two disciplines, researchers eliciting higher conceptions of understanding media.
