1. Needs and Gratifications

Uses and applications approaches emphasize motivating the perceived needs of audience members.
Jay Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people consume the same communication medium for very different purposes. The same media content may satisfy different needs for different individuals.

Furthermore, there is not only one way that people use media. Conversely, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, work situations, and the individual's background such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media fulfill their needs. Thus, audience members are aware of and can state their desires for gratification for using different media. Blumler and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to identify four important media gratifications: 1) Informational needs fulfillment of routine or problems; 2) Personal relationships - companionship, social comfort; 3) Personal identity - self-reinforcement, reality exploration; and 4) Surveillance (forms of internal: self-image.

Also, Lher Ube Al. recognized the audience's imagination was taken beyond Blumler's generative theory of human needs. He distinguished between three types of needs: cognitive, affective, and then he added three dimensions: "aesthetics" versus "aesthetics" inclination, "external orientation" versus "internal goal orientation, and emotion stability of "proud and "presentation" when combined, these factors yield 16 different types of motivation which apply to media (Figure 1). A summarizing of 16 general gratifications of users metatheory (Mitzu 1984). Gunewitch and Maier (1979) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding.
2. Aesthetic needs, including amusement, escape, feelings.
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability stories.
4. Societal integrative needs, including integration with family and friends.
5. Escapist/entertainment needs, including escape and diversion.

Concurrently, R Function's (1969) classification of the immediate and ongoing common functions of the media is useful:
- finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world
- seeking advice on practical matters or opinions of decision choices
- gratifying curiosity and general interest
- feeling a sense of participation
- gaining a sense of security through knowledge acquisition
- receiving reinforcement for personal values
- finding models of behavior
- identify with valued others in the media
- gaining insight into oneself
