Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the idea of the influence of propaganda, Lippmann and the others emphasized the fact that the public is often influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and Bernays aimed to bring attention to the fact that the public's perception can be shaped by the media. Through the research by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays, a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of propaganda has been developed. Their work has shed light on various aspects such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and framing, as well as the potential impact that the media can have on shaping public opinion. The theorists from Ellul to Bernays have shown how the media can directly influence the thoughts and beliefs of the public. While some argue that the media might not have a significant impact, they also acknowledge that it can shape public discourse. This line of thinking has paved the way for future research in the area of the limited effects of the media. Studies on limited effects by researchers like Langer and Katz, as well as McCombs and Shaw, have been crucial in understanding the complex dynamics of media influence. Overall, the research in this area has been instrumental in unraveling the complexities of media manipulation and the formation of public opinion. The theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul may have emerged years ago, but they continue to provide valuable insights into the society we live in today.
