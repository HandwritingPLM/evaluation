Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.

The following scholars explore how communication can be a vehicle for individuals within one group to reduce:

1. Early Influences

Festinger significantly contributed to the understanding of uncertainty in communication. The influence of his work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics. Festinger had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester but in 1944 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics after Lewin's death. Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research. Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and in the development of WRT. Festinger is best known for the theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) explains how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual, as observed by Lewin regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for relationships to occur among cognitive elements, with one type being a consistent relationship where cognitions are in equilibrium, another type being a dissonant relationship where cognitions are in conflict, and the last type being an irrelevant relationship where the cognitions have no effect on one another (West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance theory focuses on the presence of arousal and discomfort, leading individuals to seek resolution. Social Comparison Theory posits that individuals seek validation by comparing themselves to others with similar characteristics when uncertain about their opinions or behaviors in a specific situation (Festinger, 1982). Festinger's work greatly influenced social psychology research, as acknowledged by Argon (Festinger, 1980).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1985)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in psychology from the University of Graz, Austria. Heider worked with mathematicians and psychologists such as Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka in Europe. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin's substantial impact on his thinking and work. In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of Kansas, where he spent the remainder of his career.
