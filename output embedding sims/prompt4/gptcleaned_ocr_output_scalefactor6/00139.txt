Jagad through the realms of psychology and sociology, it was accepted that communication studies have significantly evolved over the past 100 years. With influenced by valuable legacies and advancements in the understanding of media communication, a variety of approaches were suggested to be utilized, including the original paradigm in the social sciences (Bhimler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, the area of communication overlaps with media's effects on people. For example, a classic theory, the Hypodermic Syringe Model, suggests that “the mass media have a direct, immediate effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the conscious minds of the masses” (Ivalion, n.d.).

After that, a shift influenced studies on communication from the 1950s to the 1980s, particularly with the reconceptualization of the relationship between media and audiences, as well as the uses and gratifications approach which emerged in those years. The exploration of motivations that drive people to engage with various media dates back to the 1940s, where researchers became interested in understanding different media content like soap operas, radio programs, and newspapers. Researchers discovered a set of functions served either by specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1976), for instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice, support, or emotional release (Herring, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948). Similarly, newspapers were discovered to be important in providing readers with a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and a structure to daily routines (Berelson, 1949). Due to their diverse dimensions of use and satisfaction, psychological researchers (1944) marked them with the term “prealifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s as television grew. Some basic assumptions of the approach were reconsidered during that era. Among the scholars focusing on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz was one of the most well-known scholars who contributed significantly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is considered both an academic and a visionary. He earned his Ph.D. in Psychology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1969. Over the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its Experimental Scholar Program.

Katz's collaborator in Communication Research is Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one of the pioneers of gratifications research. Their collaborative work produced important insights connecting the concept of gratifications with functional theory. Later, Katz introduced the “uses and gratifications” model where he discussed the notion that people use the media for their benefit, as noted by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973). This is known as the uses and gratifications research which was developed. They identified the mass media as a means through which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people use the media to fulfill their needs. They made informed choices in terms of what they require (Katz et al., 1974). They also identified that the media served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and integration for both society and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
