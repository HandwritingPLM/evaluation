Defining Uncertainty

and stillied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (189) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
were a number of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively low.

ason heeer related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but they also
ced to the development of WRT. Berger and Calabrese (14) adopted concepts from the
information processes as well as Helges (1955) research in motivation. Berger and Calabrese (25)
expanded the concept so that uncertainty represents “the extent to which each interactant may be unaware
of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave” (p. 18). The greater the
the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre-

ved of uncertainty that exists in similarity
hehaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with the problem of
predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way
that they do, Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of these
