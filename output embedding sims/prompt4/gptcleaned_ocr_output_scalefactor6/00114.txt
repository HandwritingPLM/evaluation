needs and gratifications

Uses and gratifications

Stuart's approach emphasizes motives and the specific needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can interpret the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media uses (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situations, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's ideas about what they can gain from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can establish their own motives and gratifications for using media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media gratification interactions" to classify four main media gratifications: (1) diversion: escape from routine and stress, emotional peace; (2) personal relationships: companionship, social utility; (3) personal identity: self-reference, reality exploration, value reinforcement; and (4) surveillance: information seeking.

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (194). based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: dogmatic-attitudinal. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotional stability of "growth" and "preservation" when charted. These factors yield different types of needs which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1 shows a structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motive (McQuire, L974, Katz, Gurevitch and Hass, 1972) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological aspects of media and are included in the following categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding.
2. Aesthetic needs, including pleasure feelings.
3. Personal integrative needs, including self-esteem, status.
4. Social integrative needs, involving interacting with family and friends.
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

In conclusion, the classification of the following gratifications for media use:

- finding out about relevant events and issues in immediate surroundings, society, and the world.
- seeking advice on practical matters or opinions and decision choices.
- satisfying curiosity among personal spheres.
- learning: self-education.
- gaining a sense of security through knowledge and information.
- finding reinforcement for personal values.
- finding models of behavior.
- identifying with valued characters.
- gaining insight into oneself.
