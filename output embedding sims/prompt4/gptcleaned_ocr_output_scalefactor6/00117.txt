Rogers was born in Carlinville, Illinois in 1931. He earned his BA, MA, and PhD degrees from the University of Iowa. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, in 1984, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Rome. The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and its applications of diffusion theory in such fields as geography, commerce, psychology, political science, and, as previously mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2008. 
According to Rogers (1995), diffusion refers to "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation can be an idea, practice, or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels" (p. 409). That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass media, people can get information on an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful.
Lasswell (1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, i.e., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect. Rogers (2003) mentioned, "this S-M-C-R communication model is complemented chiefly by the elements of diffusion" (p. 1). Specifically, (1) sender can be innovators or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) Channel can be interpersonal or mass media, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally, the effects can be individual's adoption of social change. In the diffusion theory, the "Time" variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (2003), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1) the innovation-decision process, (2) innovativeness, (3) an innovation's rate of adoption. Most diffusion research shows an S-shaped curve of adoption. Stages show how and when adopters adopt an innovation, such as deference decision-making, adoption process hump, betrayal. Adoption has become an important factor in government efficiency, the core proactive, the ultimate positive people. In addition, the theory can also direct to practical ways, both about consideration and slight evidence.
There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process. According to Innovativeness "1. Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (deliberate), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)" (Rogers, 2003, pp. 189-8). Rogers defined his term as "the degree to which an individual can be relatively earlier in adopting a new idea than other members of his social system" (Rogers, 2003, p.40). Figure 1 shows the relationship between types of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, those categories follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped, two-sided, equal variance dies in fusion! Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in an S-shaped curve. However, since different types of innovators exist, the rate of adoption and time line speed can be different. Rogers also mentioned that decision-making during innovation processes is difficult. Figures show curves of diffusions for innovations. Source: www.mivuc.co.jp/englishcase/interpretation-of-information.
When it comes to the process of innovation-decision, Pepper (1995) mentioned that there are three stages.
1. Knowledge (collective exposure or awareness of innovation)
2. Persuasion (people have positive or negative attitudes towards innovations)
3. Adoption (Decision: people decide to adopt the innovation)
4. Implementation (regular or standard practice)
5. Confirmation (competing and evaluating)
