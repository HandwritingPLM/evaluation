Needs and Gratifications

The initial assumptions were staked in a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Grenwich in 1974. They provide a framework for understanding the connection between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of mass media. It is central to the goal-oriented practices of media use and shaped by more or less definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience.

2. In the mass communication process, much initiative in finding real gratification and media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and behavior.

3. The audience competes with other sources of satisfaction, with the tasks of communication constituting but a segment of the wider range of basic needs. The degree to which they can be adequately met through media surely varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - i.e., people are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in conversations, or at least recognize them when confronted with them in intelligible and formalized verbal formulations.

5. Value judgments over the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored in a clear or more complex manner (pp. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Gurevitch, and Grenwich also commented that although previous research on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people, it is essential to analyse the relationship between these gratifications. They suggest that future research on needs and gratifications should concern the following aspects: "[1) the social and the psychological origins of (2) needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which should be (5) differential exposure (to engaging or other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification, and (7) other occurrences, perhaps more connected ones" (Katz et al., 1974, p20). The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation for blending the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, the research on this has been strengthened and progressed. The current areas of uses and gratifications based on Katz's findings, particularly as new media forms have emerged in an electronic information age where people have more options of media use.

Needs and Gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication sources for different purposes, thus positing that there are correctives (Harder & Katz, 1973) such as age, financial status, education, or the individual's background that can influence people's knowledge of what they want from media and which media alternatives are perceived as suitable. Audience members are evidence of and can consider their own needs and gratifications for using different types of media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "five types of gratifications." Four important findings are:
