Needs and Gratification

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz et al. 1974 as follows:

Mass Communication can come from a broader range of human needs,

Methodologically speaking. many of the goods of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- I.e., people
culturally self-aware to be able to repeat the niceties and motives in
Particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience demands are explored on their own terms, (e.g. L317.

In addition, Katz, Shoemaker, and Gurevitch have commented that, although previous researches on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that atest people of the media, they did not achieve the
connections between these predispositions (Katz et al, 1974). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
cations research deal with following aspects: (1) Us social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (i) the mass media or other sources which read on (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (5) media gratifications and (7) other
consequences, perhaps most experienced ames" (Katz et al, 1974b, p20) The sturos of Boyer and
his colleagues laid a theoretical groundwork of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended The careful slice of uses and
