Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories.

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of their predecessors, Bernays and Lippmann have been influential in understanding the effects of the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has led to empirical research that aims to help understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the work of researchers like Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays and their studies, a comprehensive understanding of the media has been developed. The field now delves into various roles and functions such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and framing, and their potential effects on the public. The theories presented in this paper are closely tied to exploring the direct effects and unintended consequences of propaganda. These studies aimed to understand not only the mass dissemination of information but also its influence on individual thought processes. It was this type of thinking that led to an emerging interest in exploring the broader effects of the media. Significant contributions were made through the works of Lasswell and Lippmann, suggesting that media not only shapes public opinion but also influences how people think about various issues. This line of thinking has sparked further research into the complex effects of the media, as evidenced by the work of Lippmann and Lasswell. Overall, the research discussed in this paper has been very important in understanding the media, the manipulation of the public, and the construction of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul were developed in the past century, they continue to be highly relevant in today's society.
