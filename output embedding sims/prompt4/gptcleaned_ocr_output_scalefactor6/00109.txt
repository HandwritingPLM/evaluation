Needs and Gratifications

The mass communication approach emphasizes desires and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Ball-Rokeach and Katz (1974) emphasized that different people can use the same information for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media content; rather, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Ball-Rokeach & Katz, 1974).

These needs, social status, and an individual's background can influence people's ideas about what they want from media and which media are best for fulfilling those needs. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media user interactions" to classify four important media gratifications.
