Needs and Gratifications

Week and gratification approach emphasized on the ration and Berrigan calls that different people have different needs they come into communication for different purposes. The same media content can serve different purposes for different individuals. This is one way that evaluates the media as there are media for core psychological distinction, and the individual's background, such as personal experience, education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media which is the reach. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their media needs using different needs, And products, Blumer, and Brown [1972] proposed a model of eight interactions” to capacity for important media gratifications: (1) Diversions from routine of peoblems, affording release; (2) Personal relationships companionship; social weful; (3) Personal identity social prestige; personal identity; Self-esteem or value of self-concept; and (4) Surveillance [Potter et al.ii

There are different individual needs classified by Deci (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: extrinsic and intrinsic. Then he added three dimensions: “active versus “passive” initiation, “inner versus “external” goal orientation, and freedom of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 2, As structuring of both general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 25 needs taken from the sociology and psychology connecting one of the nine areas and pairing their needs into categories.

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;
2. Affective need, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;
3. Personal Integration needs, including security, self-esteem, belonging.

The basic perceived needs of audience are as follows

4. Social integration needs, including social contact, social groups and friends, and
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Similarly, McQuail’s (1969) classification of the following common reasons for media use;

* finding out about recent events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society and the world

* seeking advice on practical matters or on opinion and decision choices
* satisfying curiosity and general interest
* learning for self-education
* aiming needs of security through broad perspective

* finding reinforcement for personal values
* finding models of behavior
* identifying with valued other in the media
* escaping from everyday problems.
