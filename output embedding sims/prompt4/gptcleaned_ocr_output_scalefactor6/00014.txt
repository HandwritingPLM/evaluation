1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the field of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2015). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a significant role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Peninger, Hilder, Believ, and Howie. By the 1970s, research interests began shifting into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and social relational control. This was influenced by the research of scholars such as Knapp, Mehrabian, Alisa, Taylor, Deetz, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Flanagan, Holoff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burpesn, and Patterson. Berger (2015) stated: "these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past two decades" (p. 406). Today, interpersonal communication is seen as an adaptive communication, comprising face-to-face interaction of communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been noted that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major theme of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter aims to focus on those theorists who pioneered the presence of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central to our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important concept, necessary for the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concern originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high demand of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal, hence adding to the high level of uncertainty in the situation. Shannon and Weaver contributed to the development of Information Theory. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the management theories as well as Heider's (1948) research in the area. Berger and Calabrese (1975) added the concept of uncertainty in interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the "number of alternative ways in which each interaction may behave" (p. 10). The greater the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behavior and occurrences. Therefore, individuals are faced with problems in predicting behavior and explaining why partners behave or believe in a certain way. Berger and Bradac's (1992) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say." Uncertainty plays a significant role when individuals are faced with complex situations. High levels of uncertainty can adversely impact relationships and people.  Unfortunately, higher levels of uncertainty can lead to misunderstandings and difficulties in communication comprehension. However, competent communicators rely on uncertainty to develop relationships, while being able to engage in meaningful and productive interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty can lead to more natural and comfortable behavior, increased level of intimacy, and more likability. In contrast, excessive certainty and predictability can hinder a collaborative partnership, as Heath and Boyan (2008) say: "Too much certainty and predictability can deaden a relationship."
