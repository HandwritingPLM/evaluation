Gratifications: A Reappraisal

The ways in which the media gratify different needs vary greatly. Needs theory suggests that people seek gratifications from media based on what they need at that particular time. Additionally, there are overlaying elements such as personal background factors including age, ethnicity, and education, which influence individuals' interpretations of what they seek from media and how they gratify those needs. Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch (1973) identified that a person's social and psychological needs play a significant role in determining media consumption habits. Individuals can choose media content that caters to their personal needs, creating a cyclical relationship. Palmgreen and Rayburn (1972) proposed three main human needs: emotional, social, and cognitive. Based on this individualized perspective of media consumption, Perse and Rubin suggested a generalized theory of human needs. They emphasized the distinction between types of needs: cognitive, affective, personal integrative, and social integrative needs, further adding the dimensions of "arousal" versus "relaxation," "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and discrimination ability of media users.

These factors will determine the types of content that will best fulfill those needs (Figure 1).

A study conducted by Berelson and Steiner in 1964 provides an overview of seven general motives for media consumption:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, facts, and knowledge.

2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, and feelings.

3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, identity, and self-esteem.

4. Social integrative needs, including relating with family and friends.

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Overall, Media gratifications theory provides a classification of common reasons for media use, including:

- Finding out about current events and conditions in information environments, socially and in the workplace.

- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision choices.

- Satisfying curiosity and general interest.

- Learning and self-education.

- Gaining a sense of security through information.

- Finding reinforcement for personal values.

- Identifying with and feeling connected to others in the media.

- Entertaining oneself.

Ultimately, media gratifications theory provides insight into the diverse ways individuals engage with and benefit from media content.
