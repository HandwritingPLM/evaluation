Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. According to Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system, and the variation by speaking actors. The former is called langue, and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signal that composes it; speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure itself, langue, is the social convention or value shared through society, which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention. Language is, therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract that one must accept entirely to communicate, as it resists modifications coming from single individuals and is consequently a social institution. In contrast, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the common language with a view to expressing his personal thoughts because speech is a combinative activity that corresponds to an individual act and not to pure creation.

Focusing on the systematic law, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form, which is called the signifier, the external part of language. For example, both the word "dog" in English or its equivalent in another language are the external forms for expressing the actual animal, dog. Saussure proposed to retain the word "sign" to designate the whole and replace concept and sound-image respectively with signified and signifier. The correspondence of the conceptual meaning in the external form is not in the chosen material but rather in the arbitrary relationship. Saussure argued that language does not reflect an efficient and actual reality of independent objects but comes to meaning juxtaposed knowledge and phonic differences. According to Saussure, meaning is added through a process of selection and combination of signs along the linear (e.g., a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms) axis, organized into a signifying chain. Despite various possibilities of selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic set, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, let's consider the following sentence: "I went to a restaurant with my girlfriend." The sign within the sentence, such as 'went', 'restaurant', and 'girlfriend', can be substituted by other signs in the paradigmatic set, forming different sentences. Through the syntagmatic and the paradigms, one can see that signs are operated on when they are related to each other. Saussure argued that signs do not gain meaning through reference to an independent object but rather through reference to each other, whereby meaning is understood and determined. Saussure's argument emphasized that every sign is created and understood through the cultural conventions of that usage.
