1 Needs and Gratifications

The Uses and Gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may have very different effects for different individuals. There are also many reasons for using the media. Basic needs, social evaluation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, influence people's desires about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. Audience members are aware of and can state their motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Singer, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: [1] Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; personal indulgence; value confirmation; and [4] Surveillance (sources of information). 

Another sub-deb in understanding the audience's motivation was suggested by Paivinen (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: Cognitive and affectional. Then he attached three criteria: "internal" goal orientation, emotion stability or prachth," and "preservation." When charted, these factors led to different categories of motivations which apply to media use. McQuail (1978) identified 14 general conditions of human motivation. Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive: needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;
2. Affective: needs, including emotion, pleasure, and escape;
3. Personal integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends;
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends;
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Consequently, McQuail's (1978) justification of the following core reasons for media use:

- finding out about important events as they unfold
- finding immediate sources of pleasure and escape
- seeking advice on practical matters and opinions on decisions to be made
- identifying with admired role models
- dealing with personal identity issues
- sharing with like-minded others in the region
- gaining insight on oneself.
