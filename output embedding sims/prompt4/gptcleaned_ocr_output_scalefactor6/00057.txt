1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Thibaut. By the 1950s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Metzablan, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson. Berger (2005) states: "these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the centrality of relationships. It has been pivotal in Uncertainty reduction (Berger, 2005). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty reduction has been a major step forward in the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research of Uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessity of the concept, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has become considered. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. As Shannon and Weaver related this variant of uncertainty to the field of interpersonal processes (1949), scholars who contributed to the development of uncertainty reduction theory (URT) include Berger and Calabrese (1975) who adopted the concept of uncertainty to the realm of interpersonal relationships. Furthermore, Budyko, Dines, and Brashers' (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted that uncertainty stems from various factors such as information gaps, ambiguity, and complexity arising from various stimuli.

Engagement in initial interactions can result in uncertainty within relationships and may be exhibited through increased verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
