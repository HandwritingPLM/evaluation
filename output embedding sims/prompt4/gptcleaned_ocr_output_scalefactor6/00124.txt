Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1931. He earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea.
The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creates applications of diffusion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously in communication. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2005 because he was suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.
According to Rogers (1995), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation is an idea, product, or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels" (p. 409).
Thus, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass communication people can get information on an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-MAC-R-E (Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver-Effect), Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-MAC-R-E communication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally (5) the effects can be an individual's adoption of social change. In the diffusion theory, the variable of “Time” is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), the time variable is involved in diffusion in (1) the innovation-decision process; (2) Innovativeness; (3) an innovation's rate of adoption. Most innovations have an S-shaped curve of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to expand the variables that influence how and why users and audience adopt new information and ideas, such as through the internet.
There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process according to innovativeness:
1. Innovators (venturesome)
2. Early Adopters (respectable)
3. Early Majority (Deliberate)
4. Late Majority (Skeptical)
5. Laggards (traditional)
