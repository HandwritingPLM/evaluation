1. Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may serve different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Conversely, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Based on needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and values, people make choices about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motivations and gratifications for using media. Blumler and Gurevitch (1975) proposed a model of "media-person interaction" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional pleasure; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (4) Personal identity: self-expression; self-confirmation; value reinforcement; and (3) Surveillance needs (forms of information-seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivations was suggested by McQuail (1974), based on a Person Theory of human needs. He distinguished between two kinds of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" media use, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotion stability of "growth" and "maintenance." When combined, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1 illustrates a clustering of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McQuail, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1974) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into four categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and uncertainty reduction;
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility and cognitive consistency;
4. Social integrative needs, including integration of group membership and self-esteem;
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Furthermore, Meadow's (1968) classification of the televiewing common interests flow of finding out about relevant news and consumer findings, leisure and their world.
