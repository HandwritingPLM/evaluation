Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception, the concept can be examined chronologically, from its preconditions, which is part of a larger point. The essay goes on a quest concerning culture, developed through insights in the mechanical reproduction of culture, and subsequently generated in opposition mainly present in Hollywood movies. This theory grew out of a number of key relationships.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Adorno never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno was ineffective applying for jobs. After Benjamin's death, Adorno then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas under modern philosophy (Migge, 2001, p. 101). This relationship with Benjamin had a major impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute, Adorno was right to fear in September 1933 that he might lose his job due to the rise to power of the Nazi regime. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began operating there. The Nazi rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually flee Germany but also affected his philosophical thought. As JÃ¼rgen Habermas would later note, the fact that such many were complicit in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical counter-forces influencing the development of critical theory, the other being Stalinist repression and the rise of the Cold War in the United States.

Adorno and the Frankfurt School were once more involved in returning to Europe from America, even ingrained in a bit of controversy (Hunter, 1998). He was, however, warmly welcomed back in cultural and academic circles, and he resumed his academic work and research during this time. Gauging that Adorno was ineffective, choosing film and radio over cinema to spread his popular ideologies, Adorno had little purpose and no remaining notable impact on politics. "The century transmuted from a sacred order into a grotesque carnival" (Adorno, 2000, p. 47). While Benjamin viewed the destruction of aura by photography and film as a challenge to the hierarchical Western tradition, in Adorno's view, the loss of the original artwork was the commodification of the artwork's objectivity. Unlike Benjamin, for whom mechanical reproduction was a challenge against the authority of the original work of art, to Adorno, mass production was nothing but the destruction of authenticity. The principles of the Frankfurt School were those of Adorno. In 1938, when Max Horkheimer, who had succeeded in establishing a professorship for the study of Social Research at Columbia University, began working in New York City and set up the Institute with Calankbe University that established the Institute through creating partnerships working in Berlin, also setting a position for Adorno and the Princeton Radio Research Project, led by Paul Adorno, reaching a new branch in the broadcasting world with other methods all the while acknowledging the potential, although he never knew what a "rabid communist" was "Hela Lonard", according to Walser, he continued to work with Adorno, though he considered him of superior quality; yet, Waldorf for the Project was in Wi., rendering.
