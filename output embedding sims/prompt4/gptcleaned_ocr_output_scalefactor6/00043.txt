i. EARLY INFLUENCES

Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication. I will be examining the following theorists to explore how communication can be a vehicle for individual uncertainty. 

1.10 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. He initially worked at the University of Rochester but later followed Lewin to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. Festinger's theories were highly influential on interpersonal communication and on the development of Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT). 

Festinger's CDT theory attempted to explain how imbalances among cognitions might affect an individual. Festinger recognized three types of cognitive relationships: a consonant relationship in which cognitions are in agreement, a dissonant relationship where cognitions are in conflict, and a balanced relationship in which cognitions balance each other out. Cognitive Dissonance Theory posits that individuals seek to reduce inconsistencies and maintain social equilibrium by adjusting their beliefs and behavior.

Festinger received recognition for his work from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. His theoretical influence can still be seen in modern psychology and social science research. Festinger's theory of Cognitive Dissonance remains an important contribution to social psychology.

2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider, a prominent psychologist, is known for his work on balance theory and attribution theory. While working at the University of Kansas, Heider developed theories of social perception and attribution. His contributions to understanding interpersonal relationships and social psychology have had a lasting impact on the field.
