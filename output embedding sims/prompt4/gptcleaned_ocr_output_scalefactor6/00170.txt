OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORIES

Other Propaganda Theorists

As Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating corect analytic tools (Peters, 2001). Specifically, content analysis can help in identifying measures of influence used by advertisers and politicians (Peters, 2001). Understanding the context of the message, Lasswell (1955) aims to trace the flow of influence from content to content area (Peters). As an aid to better understanding the level of political opinion satisfaction within individuals, he mainly deals with reference to the means of obtaining consent (Peters). However, it is the information that is affecting their decisions within politics that is being concealed from them by Lippmann (Rogers, 1994).

Edward Bernays (1928-1995) was primarily the one who, similarly to Lasswell, was particularly interested in the complexities of the public opinion dark side (Rogers, 1994). Edward Bernays (1928-1995) while examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928) defines propaganda as a persistent, persuasive effort to shape events in the interest of a government, ideology, or group (Rogers, 1994). Loony in neither propaganda thesis, one sees whether propaganda is beneficial or harmful to the public. It helps individuals decide where the public interest lies, rather than being manipulated as disposable beings. Hence, "We are governed, our minds molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested..." (Bernays, 1928).

Based on these observations, whether the public is aware or not, this is such a pivotal part of society, largely affecting the atmosphere, behavior, and development of the public. Bernays (1928) claims that the key to a successful public relations campaign is adjustment to the changing attitudes of various groups in society, generating public interest, and finally, using persuasion to influence the public opinion in the desired direction.

Bernaysâ€™ focus on the power and limitations of communication is crucial, as it helps individuals realize how much more persuasive information they are being subjected to in comparison to typical presentations of "hit-or-miss" propaganda.
