Uses and Gratifications

41.4 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential traction in media research. The original conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of certain media contents. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1980). There exists a basic idea in this approach: audiences members know media content, and with which media they can use to meet their needs In the mass communication process. Uses and gratifications approach puts the function of linking needs gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members, as their people's needs influence what medias they would choose, how they use certain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users opposed to passive receivers of information built on the "what media do to people" view that assumes audiences are homogeneous, needs and gratification-based approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1955), as audiences personalize media and responds to the media, which is determined by their social and psychological backgrounds. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates that the media compete with other information sources in audience's satisfaction (Rafael et al. 1974a). As traditional media and new media continue to provide people with a wide range of media platforms and content, this considered one of the most appropriate perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be engaged in different. The approach studies audiences' choice by assessing their reasons for using a certain media to the detriment of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Sundar & Tatar, 2006). Further research is needed for understanding the processes by which audience participants seek information or content selectively, consistent with the media's societal functions (Dalton, 1973). Audiences thereby incorporate the content to fit their needs or for gratifying their interests (Lowery & DeFleur, 1983).

1.2 Origin and History

It is well documented that gratification theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology over the past 100 years. With valuable ideas flowing across might well fit in these fields, researchers gain a sense of higher applications of understanding media.
