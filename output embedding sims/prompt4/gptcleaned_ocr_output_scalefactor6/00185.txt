Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

I am compelled to be clear about the skeptical students in my class who were finding teaching impossible. In the winter semester of 1988 students boycotted a number of lectures at the University of Frankfurt, including the Institute of Social Sciences. They were demanding a change in teaching. Bloody battles ensued with teachers who refused to be engaged in more academic debates. D. Horkheimer, M. H. Adorno, and Y. Marcuse a disagreed with them and are still being creatively stubborn. (Horkheimer, 2009, p. 11).
