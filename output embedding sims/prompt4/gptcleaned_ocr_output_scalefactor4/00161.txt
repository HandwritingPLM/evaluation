Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1951. He earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, the book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and some theory in such fields as geography, psychology, political science, and communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004, and passed away from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1955), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation shall be a practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels.”

Laswell (1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, SMCR (e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “there is much communication model that corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion.” Specifically, (1) sender can be influencers or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally (5) the effects can be individual adoption or social change.

In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1965), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1) the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) and innovation’s rate of adoption. Most innovations have an S-shaped curve of adoption. Different researches have expanded to explain better how and why senders and audience seek information, such as the influence of media models, interpersonal influences and important age range in the rates of individual’s adoption. Also, critical mass is an important factor in effecting people’s adoption.

There are five different types of adopters in the innovation process: (1) Innovators, (2) Early Adopters, (3) Early Majority, (4) Late Majority, and (5) Laggards (traditional). Rogers states that innovators are more vital in adapting new ideas than other groups. He also discusses the relationships between people in the diffusion process. As noted above, different types of people may interact differently in the diffusion process. Rogers (1962) emphasized that the success of the diffusion process depends on the relationships between adopter categories.
