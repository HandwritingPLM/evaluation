Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase, the engineering of consent public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). He said, "Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and propaganda" (Bernays, 1955, p. 20). Furthermore, Bernays emphasized the importance of the public in the formation of public opinion. In contrast to Lippmann, who viewed the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautioned against this. He claimed, "The public is not an amorphous mass which can be molded at will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that when attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be on amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in "Public Relations" (1952). Rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations practitioner helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, acknowledging the power of manipulation of the public is possible. He writes of the benefits of public relations, "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others and to persuade or suggest courses of action" (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of its predecessors, appreciating the subtlety of how the public is able to be influenced by the media, the work of Lager and Carlin as recent research has shown. To understand the propaganda and possible manipulation at work, further comprehensive studies are needed by scholars such as Entman and Kinder, White, Leiss, and McCombs and Shaw. Each perspective adds a layer to the understanding of the various media influences that may be shaping public opinion. As Ellul tended to engage heavily with the direct effects model, it is important to consider the indirect effects as well. Theories presented in this paper aim to provide a comprehensive view of the direct and limited effects model, whereby media can have various impacts on public opinion. It is stated that the media might not only be influencing thought, but may also be influencing behavior. This opens a starting point for future research. It is within this line of thinking that research continues to analyze the extent of media influence on society through the work of people's thoughts about the media. Such limited effects were shown through various studies highlighting the boundaries and potential effects of media manipulation techniques such as framing, agenda-setting and priming and the power the media holds in shaping public opinion.

The scholars discussed in this paper, including Kinder, Entman, and McCombs and Shaw, have made significant contributions to the understanding of the manipulation of public opinion in comparison to the understanding of the media. Lasswell and Ellul were pioneers in the understanding of media manipulation. Keeping these points in mind, theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are still relevant today in shaping our understanding of public opinion and societal influences that continue to help us understand the various ways in which public opinion and society are formed and continue to help us understand the impact of media continues to help us understand the ever-changing landscape of public opinion and the potential effects of media manipulation.
