1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
heats group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance,
facial judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2006). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Fiedler, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of each scholar
like Reape, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade
and into the 1950s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Blanfald, Realalt, and Berger became popular
along with research on behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Argyle, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) states: "These early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research
agenda during the past few decades" (p. 416) Today, interpersonal communication trends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been suggested that
interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).

Since its introduction in the 1980s, uncertainty has been recognized as an important construct, particularly in the study of communication. It would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
were a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this variation of uncertainty in the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed in the development of WAT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1950) research on attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the "number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 80). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences. When interacting, individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way
that they do. Berger and Freeberg's (1975) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of the
process when they stated: "uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things
that a stranger can believe or potentially do." Uncertainty plays a significant role in uncertainty
relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. For instance, fears of competency in communication may not be able to develop relationships or may be not as comfortable
in interactions. Gudykunst and Russ (1988) note that lower levels of uncertainty cause
clearer verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking. In interpersonal relationships it is expected to decrease unpredictability with the goal that this will lead to the ability
actions of individuals in what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty arises it is often
not desirable. Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty
can lead to a loss of spontaneity and predictability in a relationship.
