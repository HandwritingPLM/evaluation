4. CRITICAL RESPONSE

He complained to the dean about the radical students in his classes who were making
teaching impossible. In the winter term of 1968-69, students occupied a number of buildings
at the university at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research.

After the protests ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, including
instances where females bared their breasts. Adorno died a few years later.

Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context. Since then, there have been numerous
debates surrounding its influence on cultural production and its relationship to
business practices, including marketing.

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Horkheimer were in
the grip of an all-pervasive vision of mass culture and
the diffusion of dominant ideology in the reproduction
of society.

However, Eagleton points out that their analysis is
limited, since it does not fully consider the complexities
of class relations and the cultural practices of
everyday life. He argues that this is particularly the
case with their critique of the culture industry.

The idea of the culture industry has been both
celebrated and criticized over the years. Some see it as
a broad and insightful analysis of the impact of
capitalism on cultural production, while others question
its focus on the internal dynamics of the cultural
industries without considering broader social and
economic factors.
