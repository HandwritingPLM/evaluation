Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to understand the genesis of the culture industry, we can turn to Walter Benjamin who initially introduced the concept in 1924, and it was during this time that he became friends with Theodor Adorno. It is worth noting that while much of the early work in this area was influenced by Benjamin (who died in 1940), Adorno played a significant role in further developing the ideas within academic philosophy (Rogers, 2014). Adorno had an important impact on the development of critical theory during this period. Upon relocating to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute and eventually played a key role in the rise of the Marxist party. Adorno's work had a profound impact on critical theory, particularly in terms of media culture and the production of mass culture in the United States (Mills, 2005, p. 41).

Benjamin and Adorno both struggled with the cultural changes that were taking place in the 1970s, as propaganda and entertainment became increasingly prevalent. Their discussions on mass culture often revolved around the rise of popular culture and its impact on society. Adorno, in particular, was concerned with the implications of mass culture being reproduced on phonograph records, arguing that it could lead to a homogenization of culture (Mills, 2005, p. 49). 

While Benjamin and Adorno had differing views on the role of technology in culture, they both recognized the challenges posed by mechanical reproduction. Adorno's work, in particular, focused on the effects of mass production on artistic creativity and the potential loss of originality in cultural production. Adorno's work with Benjamin helped to establish a framework for understanding the impact of mass culture on society, and their collaboration paved the way for further research in this area. 

In 1953, Adorno joined the Institute for Social Research at Columbia University, where he worked on a research project exploring the relationship between mass media and society. This research laid the foundation for Adorno's later work on the cultural industry in the United States, which analyzed the effects of mass culture on society. Adorno's work in this area would have a lasting impact on the development of critical theory and the study of mass culture.
