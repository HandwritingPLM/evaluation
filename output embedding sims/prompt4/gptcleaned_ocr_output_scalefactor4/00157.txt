Bartels and Waber (2006) asserted that communication research has been greatly enriched over the past 10 years, with varied disciplines. Researchers have explored new concepts of enhancing media influence. Their work has led to advancements in understanding media effects, guiding research from the 1970s that examined the connection between media and society. The Hypodermic Syringe model, as shown by Hovland and Hall (1957), suggests that media effects vary by injecting information into the common perception of the masses; from the 1900s to the 1980s. Furthermore, a significant portion of research focused on the socialization aspect, leading to the establishment of social norms and values. 

Researchers discovered diverse dimensions shaped either by specific contexts or by the nature of existing trends. Hence, radio soap operas were found to effectively enhance audience engagement through emotional connection. Apart from just providing information, newspapers were also seen as essential for providing readers a sense of security, contributing to their daily routines. For these reasons, the success of media lies in engaging with audience emotions. 

The Uses and Gratification approach gained prominence in the late 1950s to the 1970s when television became more common. Some scholars uncovered social patterns observed during audience research, shaping the course of media development. 

Elihu Katz served as a significant figure in communication research, starting his career with a Ph.D. in Psychology in 1956 from Columbia University. He later taught at the University of Chicago and other institutions, contributing to the field of communication and sociology. In the 1960s, he was appointed by the Israeli government to lead a broadcasting initiative. This experience influenced his subsequent career focusing on media and communication trends. Katz's work emphasized the concept of gratifications and introduced an audience-centric approach, highlighting the role of media in individuals' daily lives. 

Additionally, alongside scholars like Blumler and McQuail (1974), new perspectives on media practices were introduced, shedding light on the roles of the audience within media consumption. They emphasized the importance of media catering to the needs of the individual and society as a whole. Their research also revealed how media fulfills functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission for both society and individuals.
