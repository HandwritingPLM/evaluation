Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structuralism. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels: a system and that created by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which composes it (Barthes, 1987, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language to express his personal thoughts. As speech is fundamentally a combinative activity, it corresponds to an individual act and not a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through form, while the form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. Saussure (1959) explains that meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes: the syntagmatic (e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g. synonyms), organized into a signifying system (Barker, 2002, p. 29). Signs generate meaning by reference to each other within the signifying system, not by reference to entities in an independent object world. This meaning is understood as a social convention organized through relations between signs (Barker, 2002, p. 29). Saussure argues that signs are meaningful in relation to the differences between them, organized in a sequence that generates meaning through cultural conventions within a specific context.
