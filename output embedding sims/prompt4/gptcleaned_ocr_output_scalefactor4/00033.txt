Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications theory, developed by Blumler and Katz, emphasizes that perceived needs and gratifications are varied for different people which can result in the same communication media serving different purposes for individuals. There is not only one way to go about satisfying many different needs for different people.

Using the identified main factors daily, there is a need to understand which media fulfill those needs. That is, audience members choose from various media options based on their motives and desired interactions to achieve certain gratifications. These gratifications include: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; (2) Personal identity: self-reference and strengthening; (3) Personal relationships: social connections and interactions; and (4) Surveillance: awareness of surroundings.

Another perspective on the audience's motivation was proposed by McGuire (1973) as part of a general theory of human motives. He classified two types of needs: cognitive and affective. He then added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" information, "cognitive" versus "emotional" orientation, and "internal" versus "external" focus. When plotted, these factors result in different types of motivations which apply to media use. (See Figure 1).

In summary, McGuire's classification of motives for media use falls into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, or understanding.

2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, or feeling.

3. Personal integrative needs, including identity, self, or role.

4. Social integrative needs, including companionship with family and friends.

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Overall, McGuire's (1968) classification of motivations for media use, includes:

- Finding out about relevant events and communication in immediate surroundings, society, and the world.
- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinions and decision-making.
- Satisfying curiosity and general interest.
- Learning and self-education.
- Gaining a sense of security through knowledge.
