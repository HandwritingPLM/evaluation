f. Early Influences

Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication:

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. He was one of the founders of social psychology and had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. Festinger later worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research. Much of his research followed the theories of Lewin. Festinger is best known for his theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory explains how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. Festinger also suggested that individuals seek out similar others when experiencing high uncertainty regarding their behavior and opinions in a particular situation (p. 107). Festinger's theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social sciences. 

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider received his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz and later moved to the United States to work at Smith College. Heider worked with renowned psychologists such as Wolfgang Kohler and Max Wertheimer. Heider, like Festinger, had a substantial impact on the field of social psychology and interpersonal communication. Heider recognized the stimulating influence of Kurt Lewin on his work. Heider's work has affected much of the field of social psychology and communication (Ash, 2000).
