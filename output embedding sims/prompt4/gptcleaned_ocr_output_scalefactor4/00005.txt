Rogers (1995) was born in Carbondale, Illinois. Born in 1931, he moved to Iowa in 1957 as a faculty member at Iowa State University. Rogers' work spanned a wide range of fields including communication studies, sociology, and political science. He conducted research on diffusion of innovations in various settings such as agriculture, health communication, and economic development. One of his significant contributions was the development of the theory of diffusion of innovations, which explains how new ideas or products are adopted by individuals or societies. The diffusion of innovations theory posits that the rate of adoption of an innovation follows an S-shaped curve, with different types of adopters categorized based on their willingness to accept new ideas. Rogers identified five categories of adopters: (1) Innovators, (2) Early Adopters, (3) Early Majority, (4) Late Majority, and (5) Laggards (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined critical mass as the point at which enough individuals in a social system have adopted an innovation, leading to its widespread acceptance. Figure 1 depicts the typical adoption curve, showing how an innovation spreads among different types of adopters over time. However, as noted above, different types of adopters may take varying amounts of time to adopt an innovation, resulting in fluctuations in adoption rates within a social system.
