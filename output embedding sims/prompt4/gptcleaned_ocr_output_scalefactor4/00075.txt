i. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2006). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and conversational conduct. This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Druckman, Kelley, and Thibau. During the later part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Holoff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Harwood, and Patterson. Berger (2005) states, "these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past two decades" (p.163). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving social interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that Interpersonal Communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).

Since its introduction in 1975, Uncertainty has been recognized as a major theme of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter serves to focus on the theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central to our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation where there was a high amount of possible alternatives, and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of ICT. Berger and Calabrese (1979) adopted concepts from the information theory as well as Heider's (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded the concept of uncertainty in interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the "number of alternative ways in which each interaction might behave" (p.1060). The greater the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict their behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with the problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do, as Watzlawick and Bavelas' (1962) definitions of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process. When they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a person can believe or potentially say. Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can cause anxiety which can lead to low levels of communicative competence. Incompetent communication may not be able to develop relationships properly or may be too anxious to engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that higher levels of uncertainty correspond to increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, decreased levels of intimacy, and decreased liking. In interactions, individuals are expected to increase predictability with the goal that this will lead to the ability to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty exists it can be quite difficult to reach this goal. Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty and predictability can also stifle a relationship. Heath and Bryan (2000) state: "Too much certainty and predictability can erode a relationship."
