Like many other structural scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. According to Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the external system and the variations among actors. This system is divided into langue and parole. Langue refers to the essential and necessary conventions, in contrast to the individual component of language, parole. Language is, therefore, a social institution and a system of collective norms that emphasize the modifications arising from social interactions. Language is seen as a collective agreement that one must respect within its community. In contrast to speech, which is seen as an individual act, language is fundamentally a combination activity that corresponds to an individual act and not mere self-expression (Barthes, 1967).

Based on the Saussurian model, language has two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is the concept or meaning expressed through the form, while the signifier is the material part of language. For example, the word "dog" in English or in Russian represents the actual animal. The relationship between the signified and the signifier is seen as a relational dimension, ultimately creating meaning through defined conventions of usage within particular contexts.

Signs do not have inherent meanings but generate meaning in relation to each other. Meaning is understood as a social convention established through the connections between signs. This understanding is crucial in Saussure's argument regarding meaning in relation to differences between signs. These signs are then organized into a sequence, with meaning derived through the cultural conventions of sign usage within specific contexts.
