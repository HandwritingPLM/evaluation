An important part of mass media use is shaped by mass communication and the degree to which individuals are exposed to media consumption. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - i.e., people are sufficiently self-aware to report their interests and motives, or at least recognize them when confronted with them in a familiar verbal formulation. Value judgments about mass media use are encoded while audience members engage in other unrelated activities. In addition, K and Gunevitch also commented that, although previous research focused on the impact of media on people, they did not address connections between different media and other unrelated areas.
