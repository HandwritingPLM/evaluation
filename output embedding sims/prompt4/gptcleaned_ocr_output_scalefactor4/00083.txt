WRITIING AGR AND POANTIO

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows:
- The correlation between media and audiences.
- Understanding.
- The importance of mass media in shaping the tone or biases that they have to offer the audience.
- The formation of audience patterns and definite expectations of what certain members have to offer.
- The communicative process may involve an interplay between media content and personal choice biases within an audience member.
- Learning about any form of media involves the changing of attitudes and behaviors.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data provided by individual audience members who are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives when confronted with them in a clear verbal formulation.
