opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1953) referring to generating propaganda in influencing public opinion made a statement regarding his phrase. And it is careful planning some (198k cold-time hit or miss Bernays, 1955, p.22). Further, audiences are warned about manipulated information. Bernays cautions against this, stating, "The public is not a herd of cattle to be prodded or molded at will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p.66). Instead, audiences are capable of thought and should be treated as such. Bernays emphasizes the importance of public relations in helping individuals understand and navigate society, evaluate different perspectives, take leadership in effecting change, assess others' efforts, and propose courses of action (Bernays, 1952, p.6). While manipulation of the public remains possible, it is contingent on ignorance of public opinion. Theorists like Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this viewpoint.

In conclusion, the importance of these theories is evident in various contexts. Building on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was instrumental in drawing attention to the influence of the media on the public. Recent research has further illuminated the impact of the media on audiences, highlighting the significance of media models. Theorists have explored how propaganda can directly influence individuals, while also considering that the media may not always have the effect they expect. This awareness has led to a better understanding of the complex relationship between media, audiences, and the potential effects of media content.

The theories presented in the paper have been heavily influenced by scholars like Lippmann and Ellul, who emphasized the power of the media in shaping public thought but also recognized its limitations. This critical thinking has paved the way for future research and encourages a more nuanced understanding of the manipulation of public opinion.

Overall, the work of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul underscores the importance of honesty and transparency in communication. Understanding the complexities of public opinion and the role of media can help us navigate an increasingly interconnected world and make more informed decisions.
