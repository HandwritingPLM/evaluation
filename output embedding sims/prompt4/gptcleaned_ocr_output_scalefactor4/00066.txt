Rogers was born in Corning, Iowa in 1931. He earned his Ph.D. from Iowa State University and worked on the Korean War. The book "Diffusion of Innovations" by Rogers has become the standard theory in fields such as geography, economics, psychology, sociology, political science, and communication. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico due to kidney disease. He died on October 21, 1995, in New Mexico.

Communication scholars define diffusion as "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time." The diffusion theory involves the innovation's perceived attributes, the role of communication channels, and the adoption of the innovation by members of a social system.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion of innovation: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. Rogers introduced the term "relative advantage" to explain an individual's early adoption in their social system.

The process of innovation decision-making consists of five stages: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. The rate of innovation spread varies across different periods of time and can be represented by a bell-shaped curve. Rogers mentioned that exposure to new ideas and different attitudes influence the adoption of innovations.

In conclusion, the diffusion of innovations theory by Rogers has had a significant impact on various fields and continues to be a fundamental concept in understanding social change and technological advancements.
