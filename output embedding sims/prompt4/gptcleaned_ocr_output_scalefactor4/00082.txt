language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must act in its entirety if one

wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it

resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially

an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code

of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. it is because speech is

essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not a pure

system of values. it is the social part of

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the

signified and the signifier The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.

The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word

dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual

animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “I propose to retain the word sign (signe) to

designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifie) and

signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates

them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1959, in PL lrg

fed), p. 37). The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not in the destined

relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference

between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does

not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from

within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences. per a e ts he ot bel
