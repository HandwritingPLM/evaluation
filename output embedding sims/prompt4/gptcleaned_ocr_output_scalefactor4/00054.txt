7. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion. Research conducted under the title of interpersonal of learning, dissonance, and social influence explored social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into educational development, and relational control. This was influenced as Knapp, Mehrablan, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Berger became popular. Into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Berger (2005) states, "these early theoretical forays helped shape the agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication is dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal pooling concentrates on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It appears that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & 2005. Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field and has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter focuses on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of URT, Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the information theorists as well as Heider's research in attribution, Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the "number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions, individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac's (1992) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say." Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development (Berger & 2000). Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or may be too anxious to engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty cause increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased veracity, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking. In interactions, individuals are expected to increase predictability with the goal that this will lead to the ability to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty exists, it is often difficult to reach this goal. Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty and predictability, high levels of certainty can also inhibit a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: "Too much certainty and predictability can deaden a relationship." Much certainty.
