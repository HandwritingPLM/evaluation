To Return to Germany

When were published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late '50s, the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises on Goethe University. Horkheimer became the Vice Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954, Adorno published an essay entitled "How to Look at Television" that was the result of work that had been done for the Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay, Adorno warned of the rigid institutional reforms modern mass culture imposed, leading to widespread psychological control (Adorno, 2005, p. 88). It was rare that Adorno addressed the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments of his times (Jager, 1999, p. 80). Adorno did, however, on occasion attempt to reshape his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1968 he wrote for a university periodical in the United States (Adorno, 1998), p. 21), and gave a video talk in Germany in 1970 on "The Culture Industry Reconsidered." In 1966, when writing the essay "Transparencies on Film," Adorno conceded that filmmaking might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the context of minds (Hohendahl, 1996, p. 11).

One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of the Culture Industry

Marcuse put forth an analysis of late capitalist society in a systemic context, as opposed to (Wiggershaus, 1994). Instead of culture serving ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms advanced through capitalist production enabled the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Beitr, 2000, p. 15). Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive affluence that kept almost all of society subdued and quiescent (Marcuse, 1964, pp. 48). The entirety of society had become an enervated arena of technology whose main objectives were to maintain social control and could be perpetuated by any means that maintained that control. Also, Adorno was concerned whether the information and entertainment aspects of mass media could be differentiated from the manipulative and alienating functions (Marcuse, 1968, p. 91). However, it is difficult in Marcuseâ€™s argument to separate culture or society from each other since Marcuse did not distinguish culture or technology as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno had done. In the end, Marcuse's analysis of society ultimately presented an opposition to the dominant ideology. Marcuse wrote, "where can the people restore their humanity and liberate themselves from their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce on an enlarged scale liberate themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? (Marcuse, 1981, p. 250). Given the pessimistic tone of the book, it is somewhat ironic that parts of it would be perceived as a call for protest movements of the 1960s in the US and Germany that developed an oppositional stance. Despite this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated into practice (Chambers 2004, p. 18). 

In reviewing the text in 1969, Fred Pollock reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that the work needed revision to receive wide dissemination. The two authors persisted, but struggled with the Fischer publishing house (heirs to S. Fischer, and may have only agreed to republish the work since pirated copies had already been distributed by individuals.
