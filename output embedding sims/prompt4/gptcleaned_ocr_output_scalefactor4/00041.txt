1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration, value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (fans of information seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general Theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiator, near or external goal orientation, and emotional stability of “growth” or “prevention”. These factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 7 illustrates structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974).

1. Cognitive needs, including seeking information, knowledge, and understanding;
2. Affective needs, including emotions, pleasure, feelings, reliability, credibility, etc.;
3. Personal integration needs, including interacting with family and friends, etc.;
4. Social integration needs, including escape and diversion, etc.;
5. Tension release needs, including escape and divert attention.

Additionally, Rubin (1987) identified the following common needs and motivations in media studies:

- Hedonistic needs for pleasure and diversion
- Informational needs for knowledge and understanding
- Aesthetic needs for beauty and form
- Curiosity needs for learning and discovery
- Identity needs for affirmation and reinforcement
- Social integrative needs for connection and socialization
- Communication needs for expression and influence
- Tension release needs for escape and relaxation
