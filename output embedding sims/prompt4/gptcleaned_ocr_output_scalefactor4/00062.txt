1. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists:

1) Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 1994).

Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both quantitative and qualitative analysis of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda, and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be defined as "the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled “Functions of Communication,” Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from canal to content and from content to audience" (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell's (1953) early definition of communication which stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 94). Content analysis was essentially the sense-making part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this view, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them, and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is all that information that is affecting their decisions within the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of showing the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann's theories.

2) Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda, Edward Bernays was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928) defines propaganda as "a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a public to an enterprise, idea, or group" (p. 3). Contrary to other propaganda theories, Bernays recognizes that propaganda can have beneficial or harmful effects on the public. It can help individuals decide what to think about or alter the opinions of individuals, but does this actually be beneficial to society's functioning as a whole. Bernays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of... With numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society" (p. 44).

Based on these ideas that public opinion can be modified, and that shaping it is a necessary part of society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of public relations. “Public Relations is the attempts to inform, persuade, and adjust co engineer public support for an action ore. Key information" (Bernays, 1955, p. 3). In the Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) provides a framework for understanding the design and engineering of a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successful campaign is a skillful alignment of the campaign to the attitudes of various interest groups, to express an idea, and finally, utilizing persuasion to influence the public opinion in the intended way.

Bernays' theories represent a step forward for mass communication theory as they reach beyond traditional paradigms of "black propaganda," and move towards a deeper understanding.
