i. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AND MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything seen in Europe. Further, the prevalence of mass deception in the United States was something with which Europe could barely compete. The closest thing in Europe was merely a pale imitation. Adorno was later born into his experience from the Radio Research Project in the US, where he observed the manipulation of consumers, and at that time he saw this research as essentially indistinguishable from propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). They both agreed on the value of empirical studies until the actual goals of the Project were unclear. Instead of an actual understanding of culture and society, it seemed to be more focused on furthering consumerism.
