MASS DECEPTION

1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS

culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything that had been seen before.

Commercialization of culture in the United States was something with no correlative of advertising in the United States (Adorno, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his apprehensions with the culture industry by noting the statistics and stating that he saw this research as being industrial in nature (Adorno, 2004, p.97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno had satisfaction with propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 16); political studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno’s dissatisfaction ultimately motivated him to further develop the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project which eventually led to the idea of the culture industry.

The relationships between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University, Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until November 1941. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Döblin, and Bertolt Brecht, several of whom found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood movies must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditions - Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industry - are all important to an understanding of his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produced (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 16). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Habermas, 1995, p. 142). Examples of this metier were the Hollywood production system, or the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplanted the work (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 84). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system, and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual (Friedman, 1981, p. 16). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 126).

Since Adorno had been a music enthusiast and a defender of high art, the Culture Industry has been highly criticized. Adorno specifically defines popular culture as a commodification for mass consumption for entertainment or relaxation (Adorno, 2002, p. 101). It was not high art that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culture industry, but modernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry, Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis. Instead, he notes in passing the culture industry, as an institution designed for mass consumption for entertainment. Since Adorno had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The Culture Industry has been criticized as being an apparent synonym for high art. Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the antithesis of the Culture Industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 132).
