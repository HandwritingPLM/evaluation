In 1931, he earned his B.A. degree from Iowa. In 1966, he worked on some Family Planning. The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and its applications in demography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously hinted, in Mexico in 2004. According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system.

Also, according to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation is an idea, practice or object perceived as new, by a mass media and in a MLA and PhD. model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E (i.e., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, "this S-M-C-R-E communication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion" (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally (5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, 'Time' variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1999), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1) the innovation-decision process; (2) inn 
novativeness; (3) an innovation's rate of adoption. Most innovations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such as the Internet. According to the evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the past the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an impartial fact in adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the more people get benefits. In this sense, diffusion theory not only can apply to practical things, but also can be related to the digital divide. There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness: (1) Innovators (adventurous), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional) (Rogers, 1995, pp. 40-41). The rate at which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new innovations. "Goes not the stem" (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure 1 shows the relationships between types of adopters in an adoption curve. Also, these categories are divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve.

When it comes to the process of innovation-decisions, Rogers (1995) mentioned that there are five stages:

1. Knowledge + or - (selective exposure of awareness of news)

2. Persuasion + or - (people have positive or negative feelings towards innovations)

3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation

4. Implementation (regular or standard practice)

5. Confirmation (comparing and evaluating)
