Agenda During the Past Decade: An Analysis of Communication

The agenda setting approach to communication research began with the work of McLeod and Becker (1968) in their study of communication campaigns. Their focus was on the development of relationships between interpersonal communication variables and the communication of specific issues and themes. The development of a theoretical framework for interpersonal communication is essential for understanding how interpersonal communication principles function.

Defining Uncertainty

Uncertainty has been recognized as an important concept in the study of communication, warranting a closer examination of its definition and implications. One way to approach the concept of uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1945) posited that uncertainty arises when there is ambiguity in the information being transmitted. They suggested that the more alternative possibilities exist and the less predictable an outcome is, the higher the level of uncertainty. Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded on this idea by considering uncertainty as the number of potential outcomes in a given situation, emphasizing that uncertainty can impact interpersonal interactions and relationships.

Uncertainty can hinder relational development by affecting individuals' ability to predict and interpret others' behavior. High levels of uncertainty may lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations in communication, potentially hindering the establishment of successful relationships. Effective communication and understanding can help reduce uncertainty and enhance relational development. Heath and Bryant (2000) noted that clarity and predictability in communication are vital for maintaining and strengthening relationships.
