Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels: the synchronic system of the sign and the diachronic system of the word. Essentially, in speaking, actors are involved. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of elements necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signals which compose it, as opposed to speech (parole), which covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 1987, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system with the social dimension. The structural level, langue, consists of the social convention of values shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression of the individual level. However, it is considered relatively inflexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists modifications coming from a single individual, consequently being a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language to express his personal thoughts. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not to pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic idea, Saussure categorizes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through its form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word "dog" in English or in Korean are the material forms expressing the actual animal, the concept in question, which becomes the signified. In order to retain the word "sign," it is defined solely by a signified (signifi√©) and designate the whole, replacing concept and sound-image respectively by signifier (signifiant), the latter having the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are part (Barthes, 1967, p. 37). The correspondence of these concepts is not a natural relation but rather an arbitrary one. It is not that there is a natural relation between the meaning and the form of the words, but rather an arbitrary one. Saussure (1960) argues that language has as its purpose to construct meaning from a set of concepts that are separate from and external to reality, independent objects, all of which are perceived through a series of conceptual and phonic differences that consist of an individual code. This process of language is produced through a process of selection and actualization, constituting a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic structure. Such a field of signs comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means all the choices within one sign placed with others. Despite various possibilities in syntagmatic and paradigmatic, the selection is always subject to complex constraints of symbolism. This system of signs within the sentence is a synchronic system, or static. Subhas (1983, p.128) placed syntagmatic and paradigmatic as fields of possible signs that can combine to constitute a sentence. Saussure prized the eventual separation of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic for their mutual independence from the external world. "Crucially, signs do not make sense by themselves by when they refer to a dependent object, rather, they generate meaning by prior signification" (Barthes, 1967, p. 2). It's central to Saussure's rule of understanding as a social convention organized around arbitrary difference between images, etc. These signs are not purely enough but explained through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular means.
