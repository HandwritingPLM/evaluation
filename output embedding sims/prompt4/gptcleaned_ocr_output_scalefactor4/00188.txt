It is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology over the past 100 years. With formed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untitled fields in these areas, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media as a sub-division of media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is purported to be originally stemmed from a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumer & Katz, 1978). To be more efficient, current, and relevant, theory on communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in theory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have an effect, immediate and influential effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses” (Walton & Mills, 1971, p. 105). Functional theory influenced that in the 1980s. After that, a high 

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as empirical mass communication research itself (Katz, 1944). Dating back to the 1980s, researchers were interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programs, such as Soap operas and quizzes, as well as daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1989; Katz, 1944; Turner & Haney, 1945, etc.). In that study, researchers discovered a list of themes generated either by some specific content or by the medium itself (et al., 1974). For instance, radio soap operas were found to supply the listener with advice, support, or occasions for emotional release (Katz, 1944; Turner & Haney, 1945); while the newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1950). For these different dimensions of usage satisfaction, psychologist Newg (1944) marked the term “gratifications”.

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s when the theory of gratifications was put up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among the group of scholars who focused on uses and gratifications repeatedly, Elihu Katz is one of the well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served as both a sociologist and a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1962. During the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work on broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication from the 1970s onwards (Katz, 1980). In 1980, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its supplemental Scholar program for post-doctoral students.

Another member in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld who is one of the pioneers of gratifications research. Their collaborative work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratifications approach when he came up with the notion that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1972), a subject which lies at the core of gratifications research was explored. They reviewed the manner by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which were entitled The Uses of Mass Communications. They took a more humanistic approach by looking at needs. They suggest that media were a two-way street, a medium focusing that best fulfills the needs of the user, and they have alternate choices to satisfy that need (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission for both society and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
