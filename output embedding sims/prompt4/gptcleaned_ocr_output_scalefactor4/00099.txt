Genesis of "The Culture Industry" can be defined chronologically, from its inception in connection with cultural production to its concern with culture in the future, and its ultimate aim in the production of movies. The fact that labor played a significant role in this process is evident in "all areas of the Frankfurt School." This established a relationship for the Institute to continue working in New York on a joint research project, conducted by Paul Lazarsfeld, and others. These relationships with the Frankfurt School led Horkheimer to set up a branch in the Netherlands, and the Institute.
