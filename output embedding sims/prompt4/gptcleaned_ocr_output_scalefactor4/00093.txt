LH well noted that content creation theory have deepened discussions of propaganda and communication theory. With Blumer's work, we are able to see a new perspective on the role of light censorship in understanding media. As a fundamental method of reading (Rogers et al, 2003), writing and communication approaches can be weighed to be of significant importance in shaping messages in the social sciences (Bordwell & et al, 2010). Their dialogue reveals that effects vary depending on context. For instance, a model often cited in the literature, the Hypodermic Needle model, suggests that "the mass media have direct, immediate and influential effect upon audiences by injecting information into the consumer of the media" (Waters & et al., p.105). Such theories influenced studies on audience engagement and behavior from the mid-20th to the 21st century. As the relationship between media and society evolved and the manipulation of people and their behaviors became apparent, there was a shift towards a more conscious approach to understanding media effects.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to watch certain media or consume certain content has long been debated (Rosengren & Stanton, 1974; Neuman, Guggenheim, & Jary, 2014). Looking back to the 20th century, researchers have delved into the reasons for viewing different types of programming, such as news or soap operas, in the context of daily newspapers (Laciffeld & Stanton, 1944; Rosengren, Guggenheim, & Jary, 2014). In these studies, media audiences are depicted as a mix of individuals drawn together by shared interests, either by content or by the medium itself (Mate et al., 1981). Researchers also sought to understand their audience, providing guidance on how to effectively engage them emotionally (Herag, 2014). Warns and Henry (2015) go beyond simply offering a model, instead focusing on how advice, tips, or opinions could be vital to creating new perspectives for a group of people. They discuss how readers digest content with the help of technology, presenting findings that are solidified through the new Canon theory.

Lines and grammar only appear here since the 1950s when television has grown up. Some had concerns about the pace of the process when it was reintroduced during half an era. Among the group of scholars who focus on media gratifications research, Elihu Katz stands out for all the work he has done and contributed greatly to evolving the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz graduated with a Sociology degree from the University of Pennsylvania. He received his Ph.D. in 1955 from the University of Chicago and had been teaching that The Understanding of Change until 2007. During The Free University Tour, he Taught in The Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in the 80s, invited by the Government of Israel. He headed the High Society charged with The introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to a subsequent academic work about broadcasting and television in information, culture, and commercialism from the 19th until today (EMA, 2001). In Los Angeles, he joined the Faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania as a distinguished Scholar, further contributing to a postdoctoral research program.

Earlier at Columbia University, Paul Lazarsfeld was one of the pioneers of audience research. He collaborated on projects that connected the concept of propagation with the functional media model. Later, he introduced a new and presentation approach when he took up the position that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), a subject which is linked to the effects and gratifications research were explored. They perceived the mass media as a means by which individuals connect their ideas themes with others and found this social bond with the media to enhance their needs. Each individual could perceive their media experiences differently (Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas, 1975).

Together with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which was entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanistic approach in their examination of audience needs. They proposed that media should cater to diverse sources that best fulfill the needs of the viewer and provide alternative choices for tailoring their experience (Blumler & Katz, 1970). They also discussed that media served the functions of surveillance, correlation, transmission, and cultural stimulation for both society and individuals (Katz and Katz, 1974).
