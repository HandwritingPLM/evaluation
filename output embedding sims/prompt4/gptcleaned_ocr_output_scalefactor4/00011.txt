Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to how easily the public is influenced by the media. The work of Lasswell and his contemporary research, meant to help understand the influence of the media on society. As work by Iyengar and Kinder, White, Bennett, and McCombs and Shaw, a more concrete model of the media has been developed.

The public has now deepened its understanding of agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and framing, and the potential effects that these changes can have on their audiences.

The theories presented in this paper have led heavily to both the direct effects and indirect media models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects, while others, like Lasswell, mused about the more nuanced role the media might play. It was this line of thinking that recognized the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects are important in the area of social media, the manipulation of the public.

In public opinion research of Lippmann, Lasswell, and others have combined to help us understand the complexity that modern society is faced with today. 

They have a key role in forming people's opinions based on the information they present.
