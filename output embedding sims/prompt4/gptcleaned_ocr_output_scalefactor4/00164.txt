Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's theory of parole. It is the essence of communication, indifferent to the material of the signifier, as Barthes explains, "it covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1987). He situates the linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, langue, is a convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. In contrast, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible within shared conventions, despite the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from language. Therefore, language is a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract that one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because language is a system of contractual values that it resists modifications from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language to express personal thought. Speech is essentially a combinative activity that corresponds to an individual act, not a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form. The form is known as the signifier, which is the external part of language. The relationship between concept/meaning to the external form is arbitrary, not inevitable (Saussure, 1959). Saussure argues that meaning is produced through syntagmatic (e.g., a sentence) and paradigmatic (e.g., organized into a signifying system) axes (Barker, 2002, p. 29). Despite various possibilities in the relational organization of signs, they are ultimately organized into a sequence that maintains cultural conventions within specific contexts.
