Uses and Gratifications

4.1. Introduction

The uses and gratifications approach is an alternative view in media studies. The origin and history of the approach can be traced back to the early 1900s when researchers started to focus on audience needs. The uses and gratifications approach puts the focus on the audience, linking their needs and gratifications with their media consumption habits. It views audiences as active participants who select media based on their individual needs and interests. This approach emphasizes audience choice by assessing their reasons for using certain media over others and the gratifications they derive from them (Severin & Tankard, 1997). From a broader perspective in communication research, it provides a framework for understanding how audiences selectively consume media content to fulfill their needs and interests (Katz et al, 1974). Audience members incorporate media content to satisfy their requirements and interests (Lowery & DeFleur, 1983).
