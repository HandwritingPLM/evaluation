4. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1) Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach implicates motives and the exact purpose of media content. Berger and Katz (1974) concluded that different people have different needs for engaging with media content for different purposes. The same media content may satisfy different needs for different individuals. There isn't only one way that people use media. There are as many reasons for using media as there are media users (Blumberg & Bate, 1974).

Socialization, as well as the individual's background including experience, beliefs, and education, shape people's ideas about what they want from media and which media can best fulfill their needs. In other words, audience members are conscious of and can articulate their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McGuire, Gummi, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) surveillance (forms of information seeking). McGuire (1974) suggested that understanding of the audience's motivations was based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. He then added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotionality of "growth" and "preservation." When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 2). 

Figure 1. A depiction of 16 general paradigms of human motivations (McGuire, 1974). Wirth, Gurevitch, and Has (1973) developed 04 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into four categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding.
2. Affective needs, including emotions, pleasure, feelings.
3. Personal integrative needs, including social bonds and social ties.
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends.
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Similarly, McGuire's (1983) classification of the following common reasons for media use:
* finding out about current events and developments in immediate surroundings, society, and the world.
* keeping abreast on practical matters or personal interests.
* curing boredom and seeking entertainment.
* maintaining a sense of security through knowledge.
