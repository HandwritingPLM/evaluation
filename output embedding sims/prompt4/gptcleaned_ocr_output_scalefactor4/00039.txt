These preconditions Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industry were all important to an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This, by mio, referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of this, not specified by Adorno, were the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project, Movies

and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,

2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be early radical change to art
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles
as someone who was allowed to break the rules; out
