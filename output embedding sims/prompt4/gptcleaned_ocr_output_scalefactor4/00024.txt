Needs and Gratifications

The uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motivations and the perceived needs of individuals. Blumler and Katz (1974) contend that different people use media for very different purposes. The same individuals may consume media for various needs such as information, entertainment, social interactions, and education. Basic needs that drive media use include escapism, relaxation, social interactions, and personal identity. Berger (2019) further suggests that individuals use media to satisfy different needs such as cognitive needs, emotional needs, and social interactions. Berger (2019) classifies four primary media purposes as diversion, personal relationships, personal identity, and surveillance.
