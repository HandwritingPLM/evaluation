Her structuralist scholars, such as Barthes and Saussure, the linguistic mechanisms struc the analysis of structural linguistics. Structuralism operates on two levels; the former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematic system of language, indifferent to the material of the signal. Speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual agreements that it responds meaningfully in relation to other signs.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning, while the signifier is the external form of language. For example, the word 'cat' expresses the concept of the actual animal, becoming the signified, while the word itself is the signifier.

Saussure argues that language does not reflect a pre-existing and external reality but rather constructs meaning through a series of conceptual and perceptual differences. This meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along both the syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes. Syntagmatic means linear combinations of signs, while the paradigmatic organizes a set of signs or an underlying systematic order according to linguistic rules.

In conclusion, Saussure emphasizes that signs do not make sense by reference to external entities but rather generate meaning through their relationships with other signs. This organization of signs is significant in understanding how language creates meaning within a cultural context.
