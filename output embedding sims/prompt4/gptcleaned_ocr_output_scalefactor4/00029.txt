The following theories significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication:
certain of how work can be reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1) Leon Festinger (1919-1999)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at | University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of group dynamics, had an initially significant influence on Festinger (Festinger, 1702). Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) allows for three comparisons: consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equilibrium; dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other; and consonant dissonance. To evaluate one's choices, the individual seeks the opinions of others who are similar to themselves. This need for social comparison can result in conformity pressures. Berger and Calabrese (1974) related social comparison to CDT by stating that "Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others who are close when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the correctness of their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation" (p. 107).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1958)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz. During his time in Europe, Heider worked with prominent psychologists like Wolfgang Kohler, Max Wertheimer, and Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, acknowledged Lewin's significant impact on his life. In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later at the University of Kansas, where he spent the remainder of his life (Ash, n.d.).
