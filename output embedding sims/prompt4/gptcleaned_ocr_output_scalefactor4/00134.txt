Other Propaganda Theorists

1. Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell harry Sactio urtimpital aralynsas of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda and discovering the effects of it (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be defined as "the categorization of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1954) as seen in an essay entitled "Elements of Communication."

Lasswell (1946) explains that content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from sender to receiver and from content to audience" (p.74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell's (1952) early definition of communication which insisted, "Who-says-what in which channel to whom and with what effect" (p. 214). Content analysis was essentially the "says-what" part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this way, Lasswell created a credo whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them, and are apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still the information that is affecting their decisions within the democratic system and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann's theories.

2. Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda, Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928) defines propaganda as "a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a public to an enterprise, idea, or group" (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bernays recognizes that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial in society's functioning as a whole. Bernays states, "We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of... It is a vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society" (p. 8).

Based on these ideas that public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is necessary for a functioning society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of public relations. "Public relations is a profession, an industry, an institution, and an adjustment, aiming to engineer public support for an activity, cause, movement, or institution" (Bernays, 1955, p. 2). In the Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) lays out the framework for understanding the public and developing public relations campaigns. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relations campaign is to tailor the campaign to the attitudes of various groups in society, gather information effectively express an idea, and finally, utilize persuasion to influence public opinion in the intended way.

Bernays' theories represent a step forward for mass communication as propaganda tactics evolve towards a more sophisticated approach.
