THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone beyond a privilege be it base of privilege
Burger. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something relatively

The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture and works did not come together to perceive themselves at all, they were mere
a base, and the 1 became an ideology to legitimate the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 1944, p. This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Forced
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Metendabl, 1945, p. 242). Examples of this art special' by Adorno were the Hollywood producing, etc, or
the CORE radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project, Movies
and [it song were based on formulas, and the formulas eclipsed the work (Horkheimer and Adorno, 1944, p. a). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would be no real change to the pattern
and that nothing controversial in the western world would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 1944, p.
106-7), Paradoxically, any innovation would only require theater, and Adorno cites Orson Welles
as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rule. The in the system would

(Friedman, 1968). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was at the forefront
of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 100), but freedom in choosing is always one of economic
coercion ultimately meant the freedom to lie the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 1944, p. 181).

Adorno specifically defines wyaaitegarde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 501). It was not high art that Adorno was presenting as a competitor to the culture
industry, but modern. Although he provides the best of an. Opposing danger: to the culture industry,
Adorno provides a question: Marxist analysis. Instead, he notes that spring break the dominant level
calls capacitive for The resumption for entertainment of Europe,

Since Adorno had been, in the company of music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a decline of high art, as opposed to popular culture
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the advocacy of the route industry
