Needs and Gratifications

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows.

They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of mass media where it is acknowledged to be goal oriented ... patterns of media use are shaped by more or less definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience member.

In the mass communication process, the initiative in linking need gratification and media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content and attitudes and behavior.

The media competes with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by mass communication contribute to a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption certainly varies.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - i.e., people are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people to the media, they did not address the connections between these gratifications (Katz et al.). They suggested that uses and gratifications research concerns with following aspects: "the social and psychological origins of needs which generate expectations of the mass media or other sources which lead to differential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in need gratification and other consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones" (Katz et al., 1974, p. 20). The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of basing the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and gratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use.

Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same media content for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974). Factors like needs, socialization, and the individual's background, such as experiences, education, affect people's decisions about what they want from media and which media are selected by audience members (who are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications using different media). Morley, Burien, and Brown (1973) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important media gratifications.
