(Cullity, 2013), Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system as the social construction of values shared through a society. On the contrary, Barthes believes that the actual value at the individual level shows the highly constructed social institution and system. As language is, therefore, a social institution and a mystery of value, Barthes suggests that we must accept its arbitrary structure. In his view, language is a system of conventional signs linking a single individual and consequently, language is both an institutional and a systemic practice that is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can utilize the code of free language with a view to expressing their personal thoughts; its banal speech or a seemingly combined activity must be consistent for each kind of personal expression (Barthes, 1967, pp. 44-45). 

Focusing on the semiotic development, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signifier and the signified concept of meaning which is expressed through a form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word "dog" in English and its corresponding form in French are external forms representing the same concept of an animal - a dog. Here, the actual animals, the concepts at issue, become signified. They prepare to retain their essential guise and denigrate the whole to replace the concept and the signifier respectively by the signified (signifi√©) and the signifier (signifiant) (Significance of the Letter, 1967, pp. 44-45).

The correspondence of the conceptual meaning in the verbal form is not in defined relationship, but rather in the arbitrary relation. It is not for the immediate internal relation of that order between the signs operating in a signifying system as Saussure argues that language does not reflect pre-existing or external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual operations or differences. According to Saussure, "meaning is produced through a process of establishment and combination of differences along boundaries, between speech and the abstract meanings (e.g. existence) and the signified concepts (dog, pet), arranged into a signifying chain" (Market, 2007, p. 20).

On a grammatical level, the arbitrary set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the paradigmatic comprises a coherence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Capitalizing on various possibilities in selecting the signs within the same paradigm, the selection is also requested by the common usage of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, let us consider the following sentence: "I went to activities with my girlfriend." The sentence is established through a linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as "I, went, to, with," are substituted for any other sign that fits in the paradigmatic, such as "she, well, or, togetherness, you, etc." Though the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure believed that the sign operates not with reference to an independent object or work; rather they generate meaning by relation to each other. Thus, meaning is understood as a social convention organized through relations between signs (Barker, 2007, p. 28). Central to Saussure's argument is relying on meaningful relations to the difference between sound, image, and number. These differences are then organized into a sequence which constructs meaning through the cultural convergence of - The emergence within a particular context.
