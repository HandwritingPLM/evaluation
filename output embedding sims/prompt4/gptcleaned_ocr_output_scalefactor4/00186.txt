J) EARLY INFLUENCES

Therefore uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication. The theories explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce:

1 Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination. The influence of their work can be somewhat reflected in the subsequent pieces.

1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the new branch of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1948 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed several of his theories, which were highly influential among cognitions: a consonant relationship in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other; dissonance when cognitions are in positions at odds with each other and an individual receives feedback from others to evaluate their performance and usually seeks to compare with those similar to themselves. This results in conformity pressures (Trentode & Jensen, 2004). Berger and social comparison theory by stating that "Festinger has suggested that people compare themselves to others to reduce high levels of uncertainty."

His theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary communications. Festinger (2000) stated, "It was in that era that Leon Festi cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, some psychological perspectives became the game changer." 

1.2) Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from a European university. Heider worked with many renowned psychologists and particularly cited Kurt Lewin as a substantial influence. Heider received an invitation to work at Smith College and later the University of Kansas, where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).
