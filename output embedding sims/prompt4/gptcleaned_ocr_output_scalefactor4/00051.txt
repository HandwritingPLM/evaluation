It is well accepted that communication has been greatly influenced by sociology over the past 100 years. With the collaboration between these two disciplines, researchers explored media effects research, using the Transactionalist Paradigm in the study of communication.

Communication theories have developed through valuable contributions, as a series of higher concepts and the gratifications approach in the Social Sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). The Hypodermic Needle model, which discusses the idea that the mass media injects information into the consciousness of audiences, has undergone shifts through the realms of psychology and sociology as well as exploring untapped fields in the understanding of media. As a sub-tradition of media effects research, the Uses and Gratifications Approach was suggested to have originally stemmed from research by Katz (1974) regarding media's effects towards people.

Functional theory suggests that media have a direct, immediate, and influential impact on the consciousness of the masses (Watson & Hill, 1997). From the establishment of studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s, a shift in the relationship between media and people occurred, leading people to be attracted to certain media. This exploration of gratifications that motivate people has been a key aspect in empirical mass communication research.

To some extent, however, functional theory, for example, a model often used in the study of media effects, has been of great importance in understanding the reasons for viewing different radio programs, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well as newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948, etc.). Researchers have discovered functions served either by specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1974). Certain media formats, like radio soap operas, were found to satisfy listeners with advice, emotional release, or entertainment. Similarly, newspapers were found to offer a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and structure to daily routines. Psychologist Herzog (1944) referred to these aspects as "gratifications."

The Uses and Gratifications Approach became predominant in the late 1950s to the 1970s as television grew in popularity. Elihu Katz, a renowned scholar in uses and gratifications research, contributed significantly to the development of the approach. Katz, who holds a Ph.D. in Sociology, started teaching in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His work on broadcast media and television has had a lasting impact on the field.

Katz, mentored by Paul Lazarsfeld, a pioneer in gratifications research, established a strong foundation for understanding how individuals use media for various purposes. In a study conducted by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), they found that people engage with media to reinforce their existing beliefs and ideas, leading to the concept of uses and gratifications. Katz and Blumler (1974) emphasized the humanistic approach to media, suggesting that individuals seek out media sources that best fulfill their needs. They also found correlations between media use, entertainment, and cultural transmission for both society and individuals.
