! Linguistic mechanism by speaking actors. The former is called by Saussure Structural linguistics. On two levels, the Systematic system and the Variation 20 Langue and the latter parole. Langue is necessary to communicate and corresponds to it, indifferent to the material of the signal which comprises it; speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 2007, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, Langue, is the social convention or value shared through society which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention. The structure of language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of a contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to resist the modifications coming from it.

A single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, Speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "I propose to retain the word sign to designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified and signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1958, in RCL Palmer (ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the concept-meaning to the form are not the internal relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation, but rather, an arbitrary relation. It is not the correspondence between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure's perspective mainly reflects a pre-existent reality independent from the signs but an association of conceptual and phonic differences. According to Saussure, meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic and paradigmatic (e.g. synonyms), organized into a signifying system (e.g. a sentence). A set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities within the same paradigmatic, the systematic and the paradigmatic, let's consider an example of syntagmatic sentence: "He went to a theater with his girlfriend." This sentence is established through the linear combination of signs in their particular context. We can relate the signs in the sentence through the virtue of reference to another. "Crucially, signs do not make sense to each other. Thus, meaning is understood as a one-way relation organized through the relations between signs" (Barker, 2002, p.29). Cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context generates meaning through the connection between signs in relation to the world. Saussure's argument that signs are conventions structured through the relations between signs.
