1. Return to Germany

were published without their permission in 1936. He Was from Paris where Horkheimer and Adorno protested, causing the Institute to relocate to Frankfurt after their return to Germany. It brings me to the Vice Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt who entitled "How to Look at Television". In 1954 Adorno wrote an essay on television that was then published by the Hacker Foundation, with the investigation result of a study that had been completed with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno discusses the implications of the transformation of mass culture into a medium of undreamed-of control (Adorno, 1982, p. 81). He would also argue that the leading theorist of his day did not take part in the culture industry. For example, in his writings on radio and television in the United States (Adorno, 1994, p. 21), he gave a radical universal paradigm shift of the culture industry. Adorno, when writing in Germany in 1966, conceded that film-making might be an avenue for a new culture within the context of modernism (Horkheimer 1965).

One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1986). Instead of culture serving ideological ends for Marcuse, social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society created the wholesale integration of the individual into the society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive and quiescent affluence. The affluence that kept elements of society in line ensured that the entire society had become organized around an ideology which served to perpetuate the control and domination mechanisms. Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the media should be differentiated from their manipulations and their quest is difficult as Marcuse tried to separate culture from mass culture and could not distinguish culture from mass culture. He also stated that Adorno was not persuasive. Marcuse's analysis of advanced industrial society allowed for the opposite view that technology could genuinely liberate individuals who have made their emotions into their own prisons and so further alienate themselves from their surroundings. He asked, â€œhow can the administered individuals be broken free from themselves and their masters? How is it possible that the old liberating function par excellence, capable of developing an oppositional practice in the US and Germany, could evolve into an oppositional stance desired by a philosopher, and not an interested bureaucrat like others who may find themselves. 

Although claimed to be associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of writings written by academics. He was more interested in the individual from looking back to 1906, thinking of the influence that they could have at least from the initial skepticism. He was looking for the outside the scope of his writing without further investigation and only distinguishing between individuals. How is it that a supporter published who could since then be commented that would since that point be published?
