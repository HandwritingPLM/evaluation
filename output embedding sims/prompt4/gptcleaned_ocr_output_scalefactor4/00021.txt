Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signals that compose it. In contrast, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1967, p.13). 

Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structural level, langue, is the social convention or value shared within a society that is stabilized and standardized. On the other hand, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language to express his personal thoughts. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not to a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form, while the form is the signifier, the external part of language. For example, both the word "dog" in English or in Korean are external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. Saussure's argument is that "language does not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences" (Saussure, 1960).

According to Saussure, meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system (Barker, 2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, while the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the game paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For example, in the sentence "I went to a theater with my girlfriend," the signs can be substituted in the paradigmatic, such as "She went to a restaurant with her mother." Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure argues that signs are meaningful only when related to each other. 

Crucially, signs do not make sense by reference to entities in an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning through their relations to each other. Thus, meaning is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs (Barker, 2002, p. 29). It is central to Saussure's argument that red is meaningful in relation to the difference between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence that generates meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
