Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the idea of understanding the public, Bernays was able to bring awareness to the fact that the public can be influenced through propaganda. The work of Lippmann and his contemporaries has led to more recent research that aims to understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the work of Langer and his team, White, McQuail, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of the media has been developed. The public now faces serious implications such as manipulation, gatekeeping, and agenda-setting, and the potential effects that these techniques can have on their audience.

Moreover, theorists like Lippmann have suggested that the media may not only have an influence on what people think but also on how they think. This perspective has laid the groundwork for future advancements in the field. While early studies showed limited effects, overall, the research of these scholars has been instrumental in understanding the complexities of the media and its impact on the public.

The theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul continue to help us comprehend the society that surrounds us today.
