Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which composes it; as opposed to it, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 1967, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, langue, is the social convention or value shared through society by which it is established and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression of the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be separated from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, a social institution and a system of values. As the social part of language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially part of an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thoughts. It is because speech is essentially a communicative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-75).

Saussure divides the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier, where concepts are expressed through the form. The signifiers, which are the external parts of language (like a dog in English or chien in French), are the external forms that carry the actual concept in question, the signified. "I propose to distinguish in a word two aspects, which I will call the concept and the sound-image respectively; the last one of these has the advantage of indicating the former, since they depend on each other and from the whole of which they are parts." The correspondence of the concept and sound-image is crucial for language as a system of signs. Saussure argues that language is a process of selection, originating from the paradigmatic axis.
