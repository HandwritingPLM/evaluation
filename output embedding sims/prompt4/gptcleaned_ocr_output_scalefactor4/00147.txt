Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase, the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be made amicable and mutually beneficial to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in "Public Relations" (1952). Rather than merely attempting to combine the aims of the public and the persuader, public relations is a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts being made by others and to persuade or suggest courses of action" (p. 10). Under this framework while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion.

Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point. The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann were able to bring attention to the public is able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues laid the groundwork for the understanding of the manipulation of the public.

Through recent research that is meant to better understand the influence of the media on the public art of In effect of the media. Myengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of how various media functioned for the public. Is possible. It has now been made aware of the fact that these media are not merely to educate, entertain, and inform the public. They have greater and more potent effects on their audiences.

The limited effects of the media are emphasized here. Instead of Only dealing with the direct effects of the media, this paper highlights the complexity of the indirect effects. The theoretical Elaboration limiting the scope of the direct central effects influenced Also noteworthy that Bernays td each lot Directly influence the thoughts of the public. Lewin their starting point for future research Me dict the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of Mccombs and Shaw. overall, the research of the scholars discussed in Myengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw have been important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public.

This paper has been a survey of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul in the context of the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us were formed years ago they are still relevant today.
