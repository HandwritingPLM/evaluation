The Needs and Gratifications model emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Media content may serve different purposes for different individuals. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974). The motivation for using the media is influenced by the situation and the individual's background, such as experiences and basic needs. People are aware of what they want from media and are able to state their own reasons for media consumption. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important media gratifications. 

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974. They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, an important part of mass media use is seen to be goal-oriented. Patterns of media use are shaped by expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience. 
2. In the mass communication process, much initiative in linking need gratification and media choice lies with the audience member, limiting any straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and behaviors. 
3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction, and the degree to which they fulfill a need certainly varies. 
4. Methodologically speaking, many goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves. People are sufficiently self-aware to report their interests and motives. 
5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms (p. 15-17). 

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch noted that previous research on gratifications did not address the connections between the diverse gratifications that attract people to the media. They suggested that uses and gratifications research should consider the social and psychological origins of needs, expectations of the mass media, differential exposure, need gratification, and consequences. The theoretical foundation built by Katz et al. (1974) has strengthened research on this subject. Current analysis is still based on the foundational insights, particularly as new forms of media use emerge in the electronic information age where individuals have more options for media consumption.
