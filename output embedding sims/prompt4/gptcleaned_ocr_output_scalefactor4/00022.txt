1. The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

The commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative in Europe. The closest thing in Adorno's experience to the advertising industry in the United States was fascist propaganda (Jaeger, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno). Horkheimer and Adorno did not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop a relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University, which would bring Adorno to the East Coast.

Because of his relationship with Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, Adorno finally decided to relocate. He joined an expatriate community that included Hannah Arendt, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred 3, who worked in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno could see actual commodity members who were engaged in the production of Hollywood films developing Adorno's thoughts on culture, as well as Hollywood's impact on the Weimar Republic in Germany.

For Adorno, popular culture was not to be treated as art. They were instead mass produced goods, for the sole purpose of making money (Adorno, MM, p. 5). Their production was entirely dictated by economic considerations, rather than artistic or creative ones (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002). Horkheimer and Adorno cited Daniel Bell and Max Weber, asserting that the culture industry systematically rendered art as mere commodity, allowing it to assume the role of authority and control.

Adorno specifically noted that the dominant economic system worked ultimately rendering it reflective reality industry (Horkheimer and Adorno). Adorno provides no set theory on the success of the culture industry, but modern Americans have been, in his eyes, an art of culture industry has been criticized for threatening the defense of high culture. Specifically, he defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry.
