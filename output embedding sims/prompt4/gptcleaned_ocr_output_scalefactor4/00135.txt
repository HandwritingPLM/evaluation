1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Communication initially focused on persuasion, with research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication and small group processes. Theories supported topics such as performance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, and more. As research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, scholars including Pearce, Cronen, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut were influenced by the research of pioneers in conversational development and relational control. This trajectory continued into the 1980s, with cognitive approaches by Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger, along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and others.

Berger (2005) points out that "these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Presently, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, face-to-face interaction, or social interaction as a means of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically centers on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been acknowledged that interpersonal communication is motived by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).

Since the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of communication as a whole. This chapter aims to focus on the theorists who laid the groundwork for uncertainty reduction research in communication. Their work is fundamental to the development of interpersonal communication as a whole and is essential in our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

As uncertainty is recognized as an important construct in communication studies, it is crucial to understand when the concept originated and how it has been defined and studied. One way to conceptualize uncertainty is through the lens of information theory: Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty is present when there are numerous possible alternatives with relatively equal probabilities in a given situation. This perspective of uncertainty was linked to message transmission, but it also laid the foundation for Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT).

Berger and Calabrese (1975) incorporated ideas from information theory and Heider's (1958) research on attribution. They extended the concept of uncertainty to interpersonal communication, defining it as the "number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The higher the level of uncertainty in a situation, the more challenging it becomes for individuals to predict behaviors and outcomes. In interactions, individuals grapple not only with predicting past and present behaviors but also with understanding the reasons behind their partners' behaviors or beliefs.

Berger and Bradac (1982) emphasized the complexity of uncertainty by stating, "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say." Uncertainty plays a pivotal role in relationships, as high levels of uncertainty can impede relational progress. Uncertainty can lead to stress and anxiety, resulting in reduced communication effectiveness. Incompetent communicators may struggle to initiate interactions due to uncertainty. Higher levels of uncertainty often lead to increased verbal and nonverbal behaviors, reduced intimacy, and decreased likability.

Individuals strive to reduce uncertainty to enhance predictability in interactions. However, excessive certainty and predictability can also stifle a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) note, "Too much certainty and predictability can dull a relationship; too much uncertainty can stifle it."
