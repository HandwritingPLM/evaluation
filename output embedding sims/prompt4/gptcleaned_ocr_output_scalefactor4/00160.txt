EARLY INFLUENCES

Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication. The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce uncertainty.

1. Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication. The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but then followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research. Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of EVT. Festinger is best known for his Cognitive Dissonance Theory, which explores how inconsistencies in beliefs might affect an individual's relationships with each other: a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in conflict, or a consonant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect. Cognitive uncertainty has an element of unpredictability, and individuals seek to reduce uncertainty by seeking feedback from others. An individual usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to themselves, which can result in conformity pressures. Berger and Calabrese expanded on Festinger's social comparison theory by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons who are proximate to others who are similar to themselves in some essential matter will be led to converge in their behavior and/or opinions.” Festinger received the Sociometric Scientist Award from the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social psychology. Festinger (year) stated, “The theory will deal with such a devel
opment as cognitive dissonance, and in my

a) Choose partners carefully
- seek out similar others
- avoid those who threaten self-esteem

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in psychology in Europe. Heider worked with many peers on research inspired by Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized the importance of paying tribute to Lewin’s stimulating influence, which remained strong even in his work. In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to the University of Kansas, where he worked for the remainder of his career. During his time in Kansas, he developed many influential theories based on his work (Heider's quote not provided).
