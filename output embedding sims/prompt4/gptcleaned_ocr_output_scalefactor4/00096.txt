Saussure, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structuralism. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two main actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole.

While langue is necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal plane, as opposed to it, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. Langue is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and shared. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression of the individual, and it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from shared conventions, the structure.

Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes sees language as a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract, which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because language is a system of contractual values that it resists modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast, to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act. The speaking subject can use the code of the language to express their personal thought. Speech corresponds to an individual act, not a pure creation.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form, called the signifier. Saussure argues that meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic. The syntagmatic comprises a sentence, while the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Signs generate meaning by reference to each other, understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs.
