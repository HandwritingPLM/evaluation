1. Needs and Gratifications

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study by Katz, Blumler & Gurevitch (1974a). They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between audience motivations and media use:

1. The audience is conceived as active, with mass media use assumed to be goal-oriented. Patterns of media use are shaped by the recognition of what certain types of content have to offer the audience.

2. In the mass communication process, much initiative is taken by the audience member in linking need gratification with media choice. This rejects any straightforward, cause-and-effect relationship between media content and attitudes/behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction, serving only a segment of the broader range of human needs, with varying degrees of adequacy.

4. Methodologically, the goals of mass media use can be derived from data provided by individual audience members. People are self-aware enough to report their interests and motivations, or at least recognize them when presented in a clear and familiar way.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while exploring audience orientations on their own terms (p. 15-17).

Additionally, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch noted that previous research on gratifications identified diverse attractions of the media but failed to address the connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifications research should focus on the social and psychological origins of needs, expectations of mass media or other sources, differential exposure, need gratification, and other consequences, intended or unintended (Katz et al., 1974b, p.20). This laid the foundation for the uses and gratifications approach, which has since been expanded as new media forms have emerged.

Each specific to audience members' motivations and perceived outcomes. Different individuals can use the same media content to satisfy different needs, and there are as many ways of achieving satisfaction as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

In light of these insights, audience members are seen as active in selecting media content based on their own motives and desires. Media effects theories should take into account individual differences, situational factors, and the audience's ability to self-report their motives and preferences (McQuail, Blumler, & Brown, 1972).
