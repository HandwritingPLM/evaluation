were published without their permission in. [46 Horkheimer themselves from their work, in order not to appear biased. In the 1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, where Max Horkheimer served as rector of the University of Frankfurt. In 1944 Adorno published an essay entitled 'How to Look at Television' that was the result of a study that had been done for the Rockefeller Foundation, with the collaboration of George Gerbner and others. In this essay, Adorno warned about institutionalized 'mass culture' turning culture into a mechanism of mass psychological control (Adorno, 2001, p.160). It was one of the few occasions in which Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it strange that the leading cultural theorists of his day did not participate in the cultural developments of the 1920s (Jaeger, 2004, p.190). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion reiterate his thoughts on the cultural industry. For example, in 1960 he wrote of a ‘pseudo-culture’ in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p.21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1948 on ‘The Culture Industry Reconsidered.’ In 1960, when writing the ‘Culture Industry Reconsidered,’ Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1985, p.85).

One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse first analysis of the capitalist system shows the profound inequalities that have resulted from society's pursuit of material wealth. Instead of culture serving to free individuals, Marcuse believed that in a capitalist society, culture merely served to reinforce the dominance of the ruling classpre Dontarchy, as opposed to challenging it. (Marcuse, 1964, p.144). Marcuse wondered whether the culture of mass society would be able to break free from this domination. (Marcuse, 1964, p.3). He pointed to the end of individual critical thinking and the rise of conformity. Marcuse also questioned whether the health of societal institutions would be eroded fr m within by the desire for material wealth (Marcuse, 1964, p.3). In contrast to the Enlightenment ideal of individual liberty, Marcuse believed that the individual had become an instrument of the political elite, a mere fragment of society. He advocated for a return to the profound values of past social movements, arguing that he was seeking to redirect the thinking of those who had become disenchanted with society's political direction.

In spite of the fact that his work was often critiqued for being overly abstract, Marcuse's insights into the populist movements of the time remain relevant today. (Habermas, 1971). Although written decades ago, Marcuse's work continues to raise important questions about the role of culture in society and how it can be transformed through critical practice (Marcuse, 1964).
