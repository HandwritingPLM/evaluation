In Dialectic of Enlightenment, Horkheimer and Adorno (1947) expressed concern that the United States had gone far beyond traditional propaganda. Adorno's experience at the Princeton Radio Research Project had shown him advertising techniques that he believed were not distinguishable from propaganda (Horkheimer & Adorno, 1947). Adorno and Horkheimer could not agree on the value of Adorno's research, leading Adorno to leave the project. Adorno later developed his critique of the culture industry (Horkheimer & Adorno, 1947), influenced by his interest in music, friendship with Benjamin, and work on the Princeton Radio Project. Adorno's concern with the culture industry stemmed from his belief that popular culture on film and radio prioritized profit over artistic value, perpetuating mass deception (Horkheimer & Adorno, 1947). Adorno saw the culture industry as opposing high art, controlled by capitalism and urging conformity (Horkheimer & Adorno, 1947). The culture industry, according to Adorno, stifled innovation and freedom in art, favoring formulas that perpetuated the system (Horkheimer & Adorno, 1947). Adorno criticized the culture industry as hindering the development of true high art and promoting mass consumption for profit, contrasting with his vision of avant-garde art as an alternative to the culture industry (Horkheimer & Adorno, 1947).
