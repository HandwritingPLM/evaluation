Genesis of â€œThe Culture Industry"

In examining the genesis of "The Culture Industry," as well as its reception, the concept can be traced through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into mechanical reproduction, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood movies. This development stems from a number of historical contingencies.

In 1923, Adorno met Walter Benjamin, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno became Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin's death, Adorno introduced a rationalized version of Benjamin's ideas into academic philosophy. This relationship had a significant impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Adorno started teaching at the Institute upon his return to Frankfurt. However, he lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party. Horkheimer had already established a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, where it began operating. The Nazis' rise to power not only led to Adorno losing his job and ultimately leaving Germany, but also influenced his philosophical thought. The co-optation of labor movements in the development of fascist regimes, along with other historical experiences like Stalinist repression and the production of mass culture in the United States, shaped the development of critical theory.

Adorno spent time at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, working on a manuscript on Husserl. While considered an outsider who never integrated into the British academic mainstream, he looked forward to reuniting with his Frankfurt School colleagues who had moved to the United States. By the late 1930s, Adorno had little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during this time, Adorno and Benjamin debated mass culture. Adorno expressed pessimism towards the mechanical reproduction of music, as well as the rise of mass music and new listening habits through film and radio. Adorno believed that this mass consumption inhibited genuine appreciation of art.

In 1938, Max Horkheimer secured a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project in the United States. Adorno joined the project, questioning the commercialization of culture and the claim that radio was bringing serious music to the masses. Adorno's critical stance towards the commercialization of culture continued during his time at the Princeton Radio Research Project.
