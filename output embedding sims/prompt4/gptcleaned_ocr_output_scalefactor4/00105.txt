Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase, the engineering of consent. He said, "Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning rather than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit-or-miss guilting propaganda" (Bernays, 1935, p.61). Furthermore, Bernays' theories represent a different approach to the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p.60). Instead, Bernays suggests that if attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be made amenable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the audience which the public understands and is willing to accept.

Bernays' view of Public Relations (1952), rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective of modern public relations is to understand the contemporary situation better and help the public to understand it (Bernays, 1952). He recognizes the power of persuasion and insists on the importance of understanding the interests of the public, and how best to exert leadership in a way that respects the autonomy of the public: a power which we are all part of, and that affects us all. 

Harold Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Lippmann is also credited with bringing attention to the fact that the public is influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues laid the foundation for a more thorough understanding of the media's influence on the public. Through this, a more comprehensive understanding has emerged.

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are critical as they help us understand the society we live in, and how propaganda could potentially shape the thoughts of the masses. The media might influence public opinion, and through the theories of these individuals, we can comprehend the role propaganda plays in today's world.
