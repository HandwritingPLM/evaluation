Theories developed by Lippman, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons.
When published without their permission in 1940, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late 6th, the Institute relocated to Frankfurt and opened in its new premises in 16. Horkhelmer became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1904 Adorno published an essay entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a survey that had been done for the Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerber and others. In this essay Adorno warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed of psychological control (Adorno, 1963, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 8 that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments of the Ates (Jager, 2004, p. 190). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1859, he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture in the United States (Adorno, 1994, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1965 on The Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film, Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hobendainl, 1987, p. 131).

One-Dimensional Man and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic complex, as other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1987, p. 618). Instead of culture serving ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society is the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Ricite, 1998, p. 144). Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and compliant (Alway, 1995, p. 53). The ideology where mainstream perspectives were to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that community. entertainment seems

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and ideology could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions. It is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture from the brutality of dominant ideology in the same way as some other analysts of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant mode.
