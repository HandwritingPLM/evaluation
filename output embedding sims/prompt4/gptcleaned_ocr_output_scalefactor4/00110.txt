CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Influencing
public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding the engineering of consent. He stated, "Engineering implies planning, aims publicity and rewards" (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays' theories also emphasize the manipulation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, "The public is not an amorphous mass that can be molded at will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p.66). Instead, Bernays (1928) argues that in attempting to influence the public, a business must carefully consider what terms the communication is made on are amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p.66). 

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in 'Public Relations' (1952). Rather than merely seeking to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p.9). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts being made by others, and to persuade or suggest courses of action" (p.10). Under this framework, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of public opinion. Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that the public is able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more recent research that is meant to help understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the work of Fenno, Kinder, White, DeFleur, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of the media has been developed. The public has now been made aware of media functions such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects that these techniques can have on their audiences.

The theories presented in this paper have led heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what people think about. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of Fenno and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars mentioned in this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public, and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
