Neuwell accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology over the past 10 years. With this came valuable data as well as exploring more untitled fields in these disciplines, researchers elicit a series of right conceptions of understanding media. As a sub traction of media effects research, Uses and Gratifications approach is impeded to be originally stemmed from a functionalist paradigm in the social science (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory does not agree with media's effects on people. For example, a model often used in the Basic: was The Hypodermic Needle theory, discusses that mass media has a direct, immediate, and influential effect upon audiences by injecting information into the consciousness of the masses (Watson-Hall, 1997, p.105). Functional theory influenced studies of communication from the Lidth to the LM. After that, a shift, which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to the establishment of new and greater approaches. The exploration of gratifications showed that people are attracted to particular media and are eager to absorb empirical mass communication research (Mcluhan, 1993). Dating back to the 1950s, researchers became interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programs, such as soap operas and quiz shows, as well as daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1969; Herzog, 1994; Wetter, 1990). In these studies, researchers discovered various functions served by different content and medium of communication (Mcluhan et al., 1974). For instance, soap operas were found to satisfy their viewers with emotional relief (Hering, 1963; Warren et al., 1981). At the least interesting, information, newspapers were also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of belonging to their social groups (Reason, 1954). For these diverse diversions of audience satisfaction, pathfinder termed matching (SH) matched (1984) with the term "productive". 

Uses and gratifications approach became revived beginning in the late 1940s, with Gehlen's formulation of the approach being resurrected during that era. Among the group of scholars who focused on the uses and gratifications approach, Elihu Katz has been one of the most well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the discipline of this approach. 

Elihu Katz was born on a kibbutz in Israel and immigrated to the United States from Palestine in 1945. He graduated from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1959. During the next thirty years, he taught in the departments of Sociology and Communications at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1980s, at the age of 55, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting. The experience led to subsequent career shifts in broadcasting and television, culture, and communication from BSL broadcast, PTV, etc. In 2002, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School and then the faculty of Paris, where he initiated a special Scholars program for senior journalists. Together with colleagues, they started company Schwartz and Krasner Öybls "a body of scholarship aimed at the growth of practical and theoretical applications in communication theory.
