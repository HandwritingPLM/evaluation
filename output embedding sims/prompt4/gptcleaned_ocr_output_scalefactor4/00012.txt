- Alongside other notable scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. Barthes suggests that a mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the individual level. Language (langue) is connected to the former part, while speech (parole) covers the purely individual aspect (Barthes, 1987, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussureâ€™s linguistic system within the social dimension, emphasizing the social conventions or values shared by society that influence language structure. Language, being a social institution, is a shared system of values that resist modification by individuals. In contrast, speech stands as an individual act of expression and actualization. The relationship between language and speech highlights their roles as a social institution and an individual activity, respectively (Barthes, 1957, pp. 14-15).

- Saussure delves into the language system at the systematic level and differentiates it into two components: the signified and the signifier. The signified represents the meaning or concept, while the external form that expresses it is called the signifier. For example, the word "dog" in different languages signifies the same concept. Saussure emphasizes the arbitrary relation between signified and signifier rather than reflecting an external reality. Language, according to Saussure, constructs meaning through the selection and combination of signs along syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes (Saussure, 1960). The syntagmatic axis pertains to the sequential order of signs within a sentence, while the paradigmatic axis involves the choice of signs based on linguistic conventions. Barthes presents examples of syntagmatic and paradigmatic relationships to illustrate how signs interact within a particular context.
