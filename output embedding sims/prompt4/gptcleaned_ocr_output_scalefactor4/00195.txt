Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Conversely, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media person x interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release; personal relationships; companionship; social utility, (2) Personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (arms of information seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal goal orientation, and emotional stability of "growth" and "preservation". McGuire identified 16 different types of motivations when applied to media use. (Figure 1)

A Structuring of 16 general packages of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 55 needs based on the social and psychological functions of the media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, involving acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings
3. Personal integrative needs, molding credibility, reliability, etc.
4. Social integrative needs, involving interacting with family and friends
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Concurrently, McQuail (1969) outlined some of the following concerns for media use:

1. Finding out about his or her world and condition immediately
2. Shaping social or personal opinion and decision-making
3. Solving other personal or opinion and decision-making
4. Pursuing self-education
5. Gaining a sense of security through knowledge.
