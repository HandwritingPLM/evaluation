1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the latter part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roltol, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Paterson. Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda over the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is mediated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on the theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is central to our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1947) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages but their work also contributed to the development of LDT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger expanded the concept of uncertainty in interpersonal communication by defining the ways in which each interactant perceives uncertainty in a situation, the smaller the chance allows for the prediction of behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are seen not only predicting present and past behaviors but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the ways that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1987) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of the process when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, stems from the sheer number of alternative ways of looking at a situation” (pp. 100). Uncertainty plays a significant role in maintaining relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely hinder relational development because it causes stress and anxiety which can lead to low levels of communication competence and decreased relational satisfaction (Levitt & Levitt, 2000). Incompetent communicators may not be able to engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) define uncertainty as "an inability to predict and explain how a partner might behave" (pp. 100). The greater the increase in uncertainty, the more that behaviors may be exaggerated in both verbal and nonverbal behavior. Increased levels of intimacy allow individuals to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty levels exist, it becomes difficult to reach this goal. Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty to enhance their relationships, high levels of certainty have been recently connected to increases in relationship satisfaction and commitment. Heath and Levant (2000) state: “The more certain a relationship is, the more immutable it becomes” (pp. 15).
