Il. GENESIS OF “THE CULTURE INDUSTRY”

Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

As well as its reception, the concept can be attributed to its subsequent impact. The idea not only provides insights into the mechanical reproduction of music, but also to Hollywood and the film industry.

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry, it must be examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation. The culture industry grows out of a concern with the production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition to a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno became in effect Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin's death, Adorno worked to introduce a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy (Jager, 2004, p. 63-6). The development of Adorno's thought during this period was significant. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute, but lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and was operating there. The rise of the Nazis not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually have to leave, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jürgen Habermas later noted, the departure from Germany due to the establishment of fascist regimes was one of the historical experiences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Adorno was in Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on numerous projects. He remained an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and looked forward to reuniting with his Frankfurt School colleagues, many of whom had moved to the United States. Already in the late 1930s, Adorno expressed little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, particularly through film and radio as means of disseminating propaganda under fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. Adorno's criticism of the mechanical reproduction of music stemmed from his view that it diluted the authenticity of the original work. While Benjamin viewed mechanical reproduction as a challenge to hierarchical tastes and class divisions, Adorno saw it as the destruction of authenticity. In 1938, Max Horkheimer, who had established a relationship for the Institute of Social Research with Columbia University, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project. Adorno, eager to be with other members of the Institute, accepted the position, though he initially was unsure of what a "radio project" entailed. Adorno's work at the Princeton Radio Research Project led him to reflect on the commercialization of culture in the United States and its effect on society.

Adorno's encounter with American mass culture deeply influenced his thinking and contributed to his critical reflections on the culture industry.
