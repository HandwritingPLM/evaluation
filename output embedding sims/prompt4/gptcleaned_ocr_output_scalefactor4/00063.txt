I. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted by renowned social influencers in the past has played a significant role in shaping the understanding of interpersonal communication and the importance of propaganda in influencing public opinion. The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays have all contributed to the field of social psychology and communication studies through their work on persuasion, personal communication, and various processes involved in social judgment (Berger, 2005).

Uncertainty has emerged as a central concept in the study of communication, with scholars like Shannon, Weaver, Heider, Berger, and Calabrese delving into its complexities and impact on interpersonal relationships. Berger and Bradac (1982) highlighted the significance of uncertainty in shaping interactions and the potential challenges it poses for relational development. While reducing uncertainty is a common goal in communication, excessive certainty and predictability can also hinder the growth and vitality of relationships (Heath & Bryant, 2000).

Overall, the study of uncertainty in communication has been instrumental in understanding how individuals navigate interpersonal processes and adapt to the challenges posed by varying levels of uncertainty in social interactions.
