Uses and Gratifications

1.1 Introduction

The Uses and Gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original conception of the approach was based on research aimed at explaining the great appeal of certain media content. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1983). There exists a basic idea in the approach: audience members seek media content, and choose media they can use to meet their needs. In the mass communication process, the Uses and Gratifications approach puts the function of linking needs and gratifications and media choice squarely on the side of audience members. It suggests that people's needs influence the media they would choose, i.e. they select certain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users opposed to passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus on "what media do to people" and assume audiences are homogeneous, the Uses and Gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). It relates audience's personal needs to their media use and responses to the media, which are determined by their social and psychological background. The Uses and Gratifications approach also posits that the media compete with other sources of information for audience's need satisfaction (Katz et al., 1973). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different media.

The approach emphasizes audiences' choice by assessing their reasons for using certain media to the disregard of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin & Tankard, 1997). It provides a broad perspective among communication researchers, as it offers insight for understanding the processes by which media participants seek information or communicate effectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Katz et al., 1973). Audience members then incorporate the content to fulfill needs or to gratify their interests (Lowery & DeFleur, 1986).

1.2 Origin and History

It is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realm of psychology and sociology over the past 100 years. With emergence of valuable theories as well as exploring more unified fields in these academic disciplines, researchers have achieved a higher level of understanding of media.
