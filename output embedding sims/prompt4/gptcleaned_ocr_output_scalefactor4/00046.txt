Early Influences

Therefore, uncertainty is a significant concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication. The following discussion examines how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce uncertainty.

1. Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty:

The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, he initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945, he followed Lewin to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of the Cognitive Dissonance theory. Cognitive Dissonance theory attempted to explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Festinger foreshadowed Cognitive Dissonance in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). Cognitive Dissonance allows for three relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another (West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of discomfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social comparison can result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2006). Berger and Calabrese (1975) related social comparison to Cognitive Dissonance by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 177). Festinger received the Distinguished Scientist award from the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist Award from the Society of Experimental Social . Festinger’s legacy is significant, and his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in Festinger, 2000) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has never been the same since” (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Vienna in 1925. After Vienna, Heider worked with many renowned psychologists such as Adler, Jung, and Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial influence on his thinking, which has affected much of his work. Heider stated his admiration for Lewin's stimulating influence, which has had a strong impact on his life: “I want to acknowledge explicitly the debt I owe to Lewin, which has affected much of my thinking and which is, in part, derived directly in this book” (Heider, 1958, p. vii). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).
