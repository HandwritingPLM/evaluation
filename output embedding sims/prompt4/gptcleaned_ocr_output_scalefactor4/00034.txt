Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

The uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The conception of the approach was based on research aimed at explaining the purpose of certain media contents. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1983). There exists a basic idea in this approach: audience members seek media content and use media to meet their needs. In the mass communication process, the uses and gratifications approach emphasizes the function of linking need gratifications and media choice on the side of the audience members. It suggests that people's needs influence which media they choose, how they use certain media, and what gratifications the media provide them. This approach views audiences as active media users rather than passive receivers of information, in contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus on "what media do for people" and assume audiences are homogeneous. The uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). It allows audiences to use media based on their personal needs and respond to the media, determined by their social and psychological backgrounds. The approach also suggests that media compete with other information sources to satisfy the audience's needs. 

As traditional mass media and new media offer a wide range of platforms and content, the uses and gratifications approach is considered one of the most appropriate perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to engage with different media.

This approach emphasizes audiences' choice by evaluating their reasons for using certain media over others and the gratifications obtained from the media based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin & Tankard, 1997). As a broader perspective among communication researchers, it provides a framework for understanding how media participants selectively seek information or content that aligns with their needs and interests (Katz et al., 1974). Audience members then incorporate the content to fulfill their needs or satisfy their interests (Lowery & Nabi, 1983).

Origin and History

The uses and gratifications approach has evolved through the realms of psychology and communication theories over the past 100 years. Illuminated by the merging of these disciplines, researchers continue to explore new territories in understanding media.
