GENESIS OF “THE CULTURE INDUSTRY”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the Culture Industry as well as its reception from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno became in effect Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin’s death "it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy." (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began operating there. The Nazis' rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jurgen Habermas would later note, the fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical experiences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frankfurt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late 1930s Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as ‘On the Fetish Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin’s optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.”

The problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works are heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph nee Bea Bee i ene original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical apace ae ae oe with sport and film, mass music and the new listening Ba oe of aura by photograph or film i ible” .
