1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz. During his time in
Europe, Heider worked with many renowned psychologists such as Wolfgang Köhler, Max Wertheimer,
and Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial impact on his life: “I want
to pay tribute to Lewin stimulating influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which is
still strong even in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work” (Heider, 1958, p.
vii). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of
Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).
