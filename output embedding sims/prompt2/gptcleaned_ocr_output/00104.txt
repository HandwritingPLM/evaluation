One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School. Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society. Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent. The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control. Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and
entertainment aspects of mass media could be differenti
ated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions.

However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end, Marcuse's analysis of society allows
individuals to have made their mutilation

into their own liberties and satisfactions, and
from their masters. How is it even thinkable that the
