Defining Uncertainty

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on

social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance,

and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology,

played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,

Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,

relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars

as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the 1970s

and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and others

along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and

Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication

agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus

on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as

a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically

focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized

that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese 1975)

Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has

contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus

on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work

is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our

understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated,

and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the

theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty

was a high amount of possible alternatives.

Shannon and Weaver

also contributed to the

information theories as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution

expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal
