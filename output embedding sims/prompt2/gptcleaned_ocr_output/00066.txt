Roger C. Ross was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1933 and earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa University. For two years during some and has become the standard is an then the saucer on diffusion theory and its applications. He then seen are on diffusion theory and its applications in economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously, from kidney disease. He died on because of New Mexico in 2004.

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion is communicated through diffusion refers to “a through certain channels over time ‘the process by which an innovation is an idea, practice among the members ion is communicated as new by an individual especially an innovation involves both or other unit of adoption. That is, by sharing mass media and interpolation. The diffusion communication ch personal communication channels” a. 409.

(1948) presented a of an innovation and assumes mass commu- 5own and perceive its innovation as of communication that is analyzed as five eke receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” significance or opinion leaders, interpersonal or mass communication accessed, message can be included).

This is a very important factor. According to the innovation-decision) time variable is involved in diffusion in adoption. Diffusion these variables.

According to evolution of media technology, ceed that influence how and why users and audience adopt the unit of analysis, Also, cri i i

: There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:

1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure 1 shows the relationships between types of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories follow 4 standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by www2.gsu.edu/~ wwwitr/does/diffusion/

Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in an S-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations (e.g., the rate of tetracycline adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed corn) can have their own different rates in diffusion.

When it comes to the process of innovation-decisions, Rogers (1995) mentioned that there are five stages-

1. Knowledge + OF ~ (selective exposure OF awareness of news)
2. Attitudes + OF — (people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations)
3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation
4. Implementation (regular or standard practice)
5. Confirmation (comparing and evaluating)
