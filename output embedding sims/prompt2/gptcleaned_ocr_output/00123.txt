1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Needs and Gratifications

The uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives: Blumler and Katz (1974) have identified the self-perceived needs of audience members for very different purposes. The same need can be fulfilled in many ways by individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974). Social situations, personal background, such as experience, interests, and people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs all influence individuals. Audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interaction" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotion stability of "growth" and "preservation." When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;

2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status;

4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Congruously, McQuail's (1983) classification of the following common reasons for media use:

- Finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world

- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinions and decision-making

- Satisfying curiosity and general interest

- Education

- Maturity through knowledge

- Learning; self-improvement

- Gaining a sense of security

- Finding reinforcement for personal values and behavior

- Finding models of behavior in others (in the media)

- Identifying with valued others

- Gaining insight into oneself
