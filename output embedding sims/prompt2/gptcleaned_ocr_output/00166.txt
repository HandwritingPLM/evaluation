1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the U.S. was far beyond anything he had seen in Europe. The closest thing in the U.S. was something with no correlative in Europe (Jager, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later invited by the Princeton Radio Research Project to allude to his experience with fascist propaganda as something indistinguishable from the culture industry in the United States (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 22). Adorno was later invited by the Princeton Radio Research Project to allude to his experience with fascist propaganda as indistinguishable from political propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious he did not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the research project would later motivate him to further develop the idea of the culture industry.

Because of the close relationship between the culture industry and Columbia University, Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the U.S. until November 1941. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Theodor Wiesengrund Adorno, Bertolt Brecht, several of whom found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno was surrounded by Hollywood movies must have had some influence on developing his thoughts on culture since the Hollywood system inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his involvement with the expatriate community in California and their relationship to the Hollywood film industry are all important to understand his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the intentionally produced (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 99). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in the cultural sphere insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 142). Examples of this, not specified by Adorno, were the Hollywood film industry and the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies and hit songs were based on formulas and the form was starting to supplant content (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would be a universal system and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, pp. 106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, ultimately rendering it an example of something that might seem like opposition but would actually allow it to assume the stance of an opposition and ultimately reinforce the culture industry under another name (Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the illusion of freedom ultimately means the freedom to buy (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136).

Adorno specifically was presenting an alternative to high art that was an adversary to the culture industry (Adorno, 2002, p. 70). He was opposing the dominant system of the culture industry, not providing an analysis. Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system provides mass consumption for entertainment or amusement and that it utilized capacity for undermining high art in his essays on music and radio, an apparent central change in Adorno's thought. Adorno rejects being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture. The Culture Industry has been coined as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 135). He specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Adorno, 2002, p. 101).

Adorno ultimately defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Adorno, 2002, p. 101)
