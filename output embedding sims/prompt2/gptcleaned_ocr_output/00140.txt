1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

A key aspect of the interpersonal communication process is uncertainty (West & Turner, 2000). Today, interpersonal communication extends beyond face-to-face interaction, or communication as

Defining Uncertainty

One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there were a high number of possible alternatives and the probabilities of their occurrence were relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the information theorists as well as Heider's (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the "number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions, individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say." Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can cause stress and anxiety which can lead to low levels of communicator competence (West & Turner, 2000). Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or may be too fearful to engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty result in increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased sharing of information. Individuals are expected to increase predictability with the goal that this will lead to the ability to anticipate and explain what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty exists it is often difficult to set goals. Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, total certainty and predictability can also inhibit a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: much certainty and predictability can deaden a relationship.
