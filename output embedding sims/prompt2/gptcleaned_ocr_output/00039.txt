THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States, as well as in Europe, reached levels beyond anything seen before. The prevalence of advertising in the United States was something without comparison to the advertising industry in Europe. Adorno was later to allude to his experience with an advertising research project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical findings and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political propaganda. (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno was dissatisfied with the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project, which eventually motivated him to develop the idea of the culture industry. Because of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University, Adorno, who had already moved to California, could not relocate to the West Coast until November 1941. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Bertolt Brecht, Hans Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred DÃ¶blin, and several others who had found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno was part of this intellectual community, whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood movies, must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture since the Hollywood system inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditions - Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, his work on the Princeton Radio Project, and his involvement with the expatriate community in California, as well as the relationship of several of these individuals to the Hollywood film industry - are all important to understanding his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business, and this, in turn, became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produced (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as late capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used in the manufacturing industry infiltrated the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization (Horkheimer and Adorno, 1995, p. 142). Examples of this included the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton University study group, and the formulaic content of the culture industry ensured that there would not be any real change to the system. This formula, built within the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles' "War of the Worlds" as an example of how the system had the ability to adapt to its own rules. The elasticity in the system would render it ultimately ineffective. As opposed to other institutions, the culture industry was an opposing force to the culture of freedom, advancing the idea of social control, limiting the freedom to choose, and promoting the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2010, p. 13). In his essays on music and radio, Adorno presented himself as an apparent defender of high art, opposing the culture industry as a coercive force presenting itself as an alternative to the culture of high art.

Since Adorno's involvement, the Culture Industry has been critically defined as a defense of high art as opposed to popular culture. Adorno specifically defines avant-garde performers as being on the side of high art, opposing the culture industry as being aligned with entertainment or amusement, catering to mass consumption for the sake of profit.
