Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as we trace its generation to its subsequent impact as its reception, the concept can be examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions through insights into the mechanical reproduction of culture. The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through popular music, but also to Hollywood movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923 and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, Adorno, according to Hannah Arendt, became in effect Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin's death, "it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy" (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Switzerland, and the Institute began operating there. 

Already in the late 1930s Adorno evidenced little enthusiasm for popular music and entertainment increased during the 1930s. Benjamin and Adorno discussed mass culture, since radio and movies had become the two most popular means to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. Adorno was emphatic in his rejection of the mechanical reproduction of music: "Together with sport and film, mass music and the new listening public signalled the destruction of aura by photograph or film" (Adorno, 2001b, p. 47).

The primary problem for Adorno was that symphonic works could easily be heard over the radio, and commercial reproduction of music resulted in an inferior product compared to the original. While Benjamin saw the emancipation of the artwork as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the challenge against the essential reproduction of the artistic authority. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school was that mass culture was nothing but the destruction of the aura. 

In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeded in establishing the Institute of Social Research with Columbia University in New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazarsfeld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what the "radio project" was. For his part, Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music. Adorno wrote for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live performance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious music to the masses. While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project, Adorno became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.
