which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., 1974). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspapers were also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television had grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars that focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in So-
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication from the 1970s to 1990s (UPENN, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), a subject
which is known as the uses and gratifications research was explored. They viewed the mass media as a means
