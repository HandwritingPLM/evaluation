1. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists
1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

Procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, "the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in order to measure certain variables” (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,"
Rogers argued that analysis should take into account the frequency with which a
message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from
source that runs from control to content and from content

His method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell's (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 84). Content analysis was essentially the "says what" part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann's theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public relations, propaganda, and public
opinion, Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion.
He defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the public's ideas or
actions on behalf of an enterprise, idea, or group (p.25) considering what is beneficial or harmful to the public.

He argues that this may be beneficial to society's functioning as a whole:
"If we understand the mechanisms and motives of the group mind, it is now possible to control and regiment
the masses according to our will without their knowing it” (p. 9).

Bernays believed that the public's perceptions and opinions can be modified, and that such shaping is essential.
This belief is reflected in his work in the field of public relations. "Public relations is the attempt, by information,
persuasion, and adjustment, to engineer public support or opposition to the policies, actions, or products of a government, organization, or individual" (Bernays, 1955, p. 3). In the engineer of Consent, Bernays (1955) lays out ways to shape public relations
campaigns. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relations campaign is understanding the
motivations and desires of various groups in society, and adapting the campaign to the attitudes of
the public, utilizing persuasion to influence public opinion effectively.

These ideas represent a step forward for mass communication. They
move away from more random approaches to shaping public opinion and
towards a more strategic and targeted approach.
