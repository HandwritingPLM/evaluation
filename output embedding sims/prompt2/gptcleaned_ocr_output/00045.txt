It is well accepted that communication theories developed through the study of Psychology over the past 100 years have been illuminated by valuable insights as well as exploring more untilled fields.

In two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of media effects research, the uses and gratifications approach is suggested to have originally stemmed from a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functionalist theory of communication agrees with the uses and gratifications towards people. For example, a study used in the thematic Syringe that "the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential impact upon audiences by 'injecting' information into the minds of the masses" (Watson & Hill 1997, p. 105). Functional theories influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift which rediscovered the golden mean of media and communication led to the establishment of uses and gratifications.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became interested in different radio programs, such as soap operas and daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & 1944, 1949; Warne Henry, 1948; et al.). Through studies, researchers identified a list of functions served either by media-specific content or by the media itself (Katz et al., 1974b). They found that media satisfied their listeners with advice, support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just providing information, newspapers were also discovered to be important in giving readers a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of uses, it was marked that the term "gratifications" remained prevailing in the late 1950s until the 1970s when television had grown.

Among gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known initiators of the approach. Katz served as both a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from the University of Chicago and began teaching there until 1963. During this time, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University. Later, he was invited by the Government of Israel to head the task force charged with broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work on broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication from the 1970s to 1990s (UPENN, 2001). In 1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania and also directed its experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral students.

Katz's mentor at Columbia University was Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one of the pioneers of gratifications theory. Their cooperation produced important outgrowths that connected the concept of gratifications with the functional theory of media. Later, Katz introduced the uses and gratifications approach when he came up with the notion that people adapt the media to their own benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), a subject known as the uses and gratifications research was explored. They viewed mass media as a means by which individuals connect or disconnect with others and found that people bend the media to their needs more readily than the media overpowering them (Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 entitled "The Uses of Mass Communication", taking a more humanistic approach in looking at media. They suggest that media users seek the medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and that they have alternate choices to select (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They proposed that media users seek the medium source that best fulfills their needs and that they have alternate choices to select.
