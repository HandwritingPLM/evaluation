CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States and the prevalence of advertising was something with no correlative experience to the advertising industry in the United States. Adorno was later to allude to his experience in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical research as being indistinguishable from political. He saw this research as being indistinguishable from political. It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not see eye to eye in their empirical studies, and Adorno left the project.

They were instead a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce. This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy. Examples of this, not specified by Adorno, were the Hollywood production system, the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work. Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real art to challenge the system, and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge. Paradoxically, any innovation would only serve to further strengthen the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles...

Ultimately, Adorno focused on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.

Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry. It was not high art to the culture industry, but modernism. Although he provides no overt Marxist analysis.
