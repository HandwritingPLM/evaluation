1. Early Influences

The following historical figures significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication. Their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger, a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After initially working at the University of Rochester, Festinger followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics in 1945. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research. Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Festinger is recognized for his contributions in contemporary social science; his theoretical influence can still be recognized in current discourse. Festinger received the Distinguished Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology.

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider, educated in philosophy from the University of Graz, had influential figures in his life such as Wolfgang Kohler, Max Wertheimer, and Kurt Lewin. Heider acknowledged Lewin as having a substantial impact on his life: "I want to think of him as my scientific father. I like to think that my thinking matured under his stimulating influence, which was subsequent to his death, although it does not derive directly from his work." Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later at the University of Kansas, where he remained for the remainder of his life.
