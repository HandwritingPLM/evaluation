NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated by the study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows:

1. They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences.
2. The audience is conceived as active and assumed to be goal-oriented with definite expectations of what media can offer.
3. An important part of mass media use is shaped by patterns of media use and certain kinds of content have to offer the audience.
4. In the mass communication process, much media choice lies with the audience.
5. Theorizing about any form of behavior linking need gratification and media content is an important part of the study. This places a strong limitation on the straight-line effect of media content on attitudes.

The media competes with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by mass communication are just a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the degree to which they can be met through mass media consumption varies.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from the individual audience members themselves. People are sufficiently self-aware to report their interests and motives, or at least recognize them when confronted with them in a familiar formulation.

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their terms (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that previous researches on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people to the media but did not address the connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifications research is concerned with the social and psychological origins of needs, expectations of mass media or other sources, differential exposure, need gratification, and potential unintended consequences (Katz et al., 1974b, p. 20). The studies by his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation for building the uses and gratifications research; since then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The study of gratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as new forms have emerged in the electronic information age when people have more media use options.

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. People can use the same communication message for different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different users. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social needs, information needs, and integration and diversion needs affect people's media use. Audience members are able to recognize what they want from media and can state their own motives and gratifications. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown proposed a model of "media-person interaction" based on the situation and the individual's background, such as experience and interests, to classify four important media gratifications.
