Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1931. He earned his B.A., M.A., and PhD from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Navy.
The book has become a standard textbook on diffusion theory in various fields such as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and communication. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was suffering from kidney issues. He died on October 21, 2005.
Rogers (1995) defined diffusion as the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation is an idea, practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels.
According to Rogers (1995), the time variable is involved in diffusion in the innovation-decision process, innovativeness, and an innovation's rate of adoption. Most innovations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. The diffusion theory also applies to the evolution of media technologies and how and why users adopt new mediums.
In the diffusion process, there are five types of adopters: Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards. Rogers (1995) defined Laggards as individuals who are slower in adopting new ideas than other members of their social system.
The relationship between the types of adopters is divided by innovativeness and shown in the adoption curve. There are five stages in the process of adoption: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation.
