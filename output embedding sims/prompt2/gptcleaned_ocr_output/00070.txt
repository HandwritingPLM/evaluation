public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or
propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays' theories also represent a different of the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as an amorphous mass that can be manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, "The public is not a herd that can be molded at will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays suggests that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms can be made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the efforts being made by others, to see the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate courses of action" (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion.

The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that the public is influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more recent research that is meant to help understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the work of Iyengar and Kinder, Levin and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of the media has been developed. The public has functions such as being made aware of various media techniques and the potential effects that these techniques can have on their audiences, such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming.

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects theory of media influence. Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby propaganda could directly influence the thought masses, while theorists such as Lippmann also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought but may also be influencing how people thought about issues. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of Iyengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in this paper has been very important to the understanding of media, the manipulation of the public, and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the surroundings.
