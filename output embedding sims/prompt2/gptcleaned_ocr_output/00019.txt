One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions (Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno had done. In the end, Marcuse's analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant ideology. Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individuals who have made their mutilation into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scale liberate themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thinkable that the vicious circle be broken?" (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the book, it is ironic that Marcuse would be perceived as the prophet of a protest movement of the 1960s in the U.S. and Germany that developed an oppositional stance. In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated into practice (Chambers, 2004, p. 226).

Seeing that the text in 1961, Friedrich Pollock reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that the In reviewing tiéd tig éal - work required too much revision to receive mass dissemination. The two authors continued to negotiate with the Fischer publishing house until 1969, and may have only agreed to republish the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals.
