Like many other structuralist scholars, Saussure believed that the linguistic mechanism is essentially a product of conventions maintained by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter is parole, with the former representing the conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material form of speech. In contrast, parole covers the purely individual aspect of language (Barthes 1977, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within a social dimension. The structure of langue represents the social conventions or values shared within a society, which are stabilized. Parole, on the other hand, is considered flexible as it is the actual expression at an individual level. However, it is still influenced by the shared conventions within the structure.

Language is seen as both a social institution and a system of values that individuals must adhere to entirely. It is a system of contractual values that is both personal and social, representing a social institution and system that regulates individual speech acts, which are not purely individual but also influenced by the language system as a whole. Speech is essentially a combinative activity used to express personal thoughts, and it is through this activity that meaning is produced (Barthes 1977, pp. 14-15).

Saussure distinguishes between the two parts of the language system, the signifier and the signified. The signifier represents the form or the external part of language, while the signified represents the concept or meaning behind the form. These two aspects are connected through the word sign, with the signified proposing to represent the concept or idea and the signifier representing the external form.

Saussure argues that language does not designate the external reality of objects but constructs meaning through a series of differences. Meaning is generated through the combination and selection of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic. The syntagmatic represents a set of signs organized into sentences, while the paradigmatic represents a field of possible signs that can be substituted for one another. The selection of signs within the paradigmatic is regulated by the consensus of the linguistic community.

Saussure emphasizes that signs only make sense in relation to each other, not to an external object world. Signs generate meaning through their relation to each other, making language a social convention organized through sign relations.

In conclusion, Saussure's argument highlights the importance of relations between signs in generating meaning within a cultural context. Meaning is not inherent within signs but is produced through a process of selection and combination within a linguistic system.
