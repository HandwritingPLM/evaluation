1. EARLY INFLUENCES

Uncertainty is a concept that plays 
a significant role in theories of psychology, often referred to as the concept of uncertainty.

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, 
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics. After graduation, Festinger initially 
worked at the University of Rochester, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger 
University, and the New School for Social Research. 

need for social comparison can be
related to Festinger by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others 
who are proximately experiencing a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of 
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished 
Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger’s legacy is significant and 
can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in 
Festinger, 1980) said, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of 
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since” (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz. During his time in 
Europe, Heider worked with many renowned psychologists such as Wolfgang Kohler, Max Wertheimer, 
and Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as having a substantial impact on his life: “I want 
to pay tribute to Lewin's stimulating influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which is 
still strong even in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work” (Heider, 1958, p. vii). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of 
Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).
