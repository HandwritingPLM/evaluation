On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure can be seen along with the arbitrary relation. It is argued that "language does not reflect a pre-existing reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from the fundamentally arbitrary conceptual and phonic differences". The syntagmatic field of possible signs are related by the ider the following.
