Return to Germany

Published with her permission in 1999, Horkheimer wrote that his own work, in order to not jeopardize their return to Germany, the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, Germany, and opened its new premises in 1950.

In the late 1950s, Horkheimer and Adorno protested the distancing and rigid institutionalization of George Gerbner and others. In an essay in 1954, Adorno warned of aegis or rigid institutionalization transforming modern forms of social control (Adorno, 2001la p. 16). It was one of the few occasions that Adorno discussed the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part (Jager, 2004, p. 191).

Adorno would later attempt to analyze the film industry and wrote of a universal pseudo-culture in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21). In 1966, when writing the essay "Transparencies on Film," he conceded that mass culture might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to high culture, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

Marcuse analyzed late capitalist society in One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry. He argued that social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist production formed a system of repressive affluence that kept society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83).

Like Adorno, Marcuse questioned the differentiation between information and entertainment in mass media and their manipulation and indoctrination functions (Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass media from society itself, allowing for no opposition to the dominant ideology.

Marcuse's analysis raised questions about how individuals could liberate themselves from the enforced ideology. He questioned how the vicious circle could be broken, given the pessimistic tone of the book. Despite his oppositional stance, Marcuse was not an activist but a philosopher who developed an icon for leftist movements.

In 1961, Friedrich Pollack reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that their work continued to be associated with the Frankfurt School. They negotiated with individuals to republish the work since pirate copies had been disseminated.
