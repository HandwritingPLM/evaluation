CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public opinion (Elena, 2018) is a necessity, with attention-generating propaganda influencing decision-making. Edward Bernays himself made a statement regarding his phrase, "more than anything else that distinguishes a set of organized from unorganized propensities" (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Apart from his own opinions, Bernays' theories also present a different view in opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as easily manipulated. Bernays cautions against this, claiming that the public cannot be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p.66), and emphasizing the need for businesses to make their aims and intentions understandable and beneficial to the public (p. 66).

Bernays' ideas in "Public Relations" (1952) go beyond mere propaganda, presenting public relations as a tool for understanding the public and persuading them. He states that the objective-minded public relations man helps clients adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). While Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, acknowledging the power of society, he still recognizes the potential for manipulation. Bernays (1952) highlights the importance of public relations for citizens, aiding in understanding society, evaluating other viewpoints, exerting leadership in modifying conditions, evaluating others' efforts, and suggesting courses of action (p. 10).

These theories are crucial for understanding the media's influence on the public. Through the work of Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw, a better understanding of media functions such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming has been developed. The direct effects model and limited effects model are key in understanding how media can influence audiences. Lippmann's theories are foundational for understanding public opinion and continue to be relevant in today's society.

Overall, the research of these scholars is vital for understanding the media and public opinion. Despite being developed years ago, these theories continue to be relevant and provide insight into the society we live in today.
