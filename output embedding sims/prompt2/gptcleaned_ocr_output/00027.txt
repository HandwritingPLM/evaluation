1 Early Influences

The following theorists signficantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication. The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and furthered Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) and Social Comparison theory. CDT explains how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual, while Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to others for feedback to evaluate their own performance and abilities. Festinger's work contributed to URT by stating that "Festinger has suggested that people seek out similar others for opinions in a particular situation,”. He received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution award from the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist award from the Society for Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson described his theoretical influence as having a significant impact on contemporary social science research.

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz in Austria, where he worked with renowned psychologists such as Wolfgang Kohler and Kurt Koffka. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin's ongoing influence, which continued to shape much of his work. Heider moved to the United States to further his academic career, and in 1929, he settled in Kansas where he remained for the rest of his life (Ash, 2000). Heider's work has had a lasting impact on the field of interpersonal communication. His theoretical contributions, derived from Gestalt psychology, focused on the perception of human behavior and the attribution of motives to explain those behaviors. Heider's work has been influential in understanding social perception, balance theory, and attribution theory.

It was in this fertile intellectual environment that the field of interpersonal communication began to take shape and develop into the diverse area of study it is today. These early influences laid the foundation for the exploration of uncertainty in communication and subsequent theories that have emerged in this field.
