CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing
public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase
And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and
Furthermore, Bernays' theories also represent a different view of propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22)
In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, "The public is not an amorphous mass which can be molded at will or dictated to" (Bernays 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in attempting to influence the public, one must study what terms the partnership can be made amicable and mutually beneficial. The public is not an amorphous mass which can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays 1928, p. 66) 1 its aims, its objectives, to the. It must explain itself (66)
Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays 1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann as he recognizes the power of society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us all, evaluate efforts by others and to persuade or support courses of action" (10). Under this framework, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not such blatant manipulation of the public. Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tended to agree with this point

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories
Recent research that is meant to help understand the effects and influence of the media has been developed. The public's agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and agenda-setting, and the power of the media to influence their audiences
The theories presented in this paper have tied the effects and limited effect
media models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to reject the direct effects model while propaganda could directly influence the thoughts of the audience. Meanwhile, theorists like Lippmann also noted that the media might not be influencing what people thought about. It was this line of thinking that served as a starting point for future
In the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects are discussed by scholars such as Iyengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw, in research of media effects and the formation of public opinion. While the theories presented in this paper may not fully explain how public opinions were formed.
