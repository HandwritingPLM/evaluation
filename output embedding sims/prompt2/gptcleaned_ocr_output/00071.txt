Generating propaganda and influencing opinions is a key aspect of influencing the public. Bernays himself made a statement regarding this, stating, "Engineering implies planning. And it is through careful planning that propaganda can be successful" (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays emphasizes the need for public relations to be based on careful planning rather than mere propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22).

Bernays acknowledges that the formation of public opinion is crucial, offering a different perspective from Lippmann who believed that public opinion could be manipulated. Bernays cautions against such manipulation, stating that the public should not be molded or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays suggests that businesses should strive to create mutually beneficial relationships with the public, explaining their aims and objectives in a way that the public can understand (Bernays, 1928, p. 66).

In his book "Public Relations" (1952), Bernays expands on these ideas, presenting public relations as a tool for influencing public opinion in a more ethical and objective manner. He suggests that public relations should help clients adjust to the contemporary situation while also helping the public understand and evaluate different viewpoints (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). While Bernays acknowledges the power of society and the potential for manipulation, he also highlights the benefits of public relations in helping citizens understand and evaluate societal conditions (Bernays, 1952, p. 10).

Overall, the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays play a crucial role in understanding the influence of media on public opinion. Their work has paved the way for more recent research on media effects, such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming. While some theorists tend to emphasize the direct effects of the media on public opinion, others like Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul offer a more nuanced perspective on how media manipulation can influence public perceptions. Ultimately, these theories provide valuable insights into the complex relationship between media, public opinion, and society.
