Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has transformed research and the development of communication theory. Information plays a vital role in human function in which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uncertainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard Calabrese (1975), emphasized that reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. They pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 15). URT applies to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced the research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT placed a focus which was a key step in the development of the field. Calabrese (1975) notes: “When communication researchers have conducted research on the communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points.” The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the progress in interpersonal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began turning their attention towards communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical sciences.

Traditionally, communication has been most often linked to studies into language, but a modest amount of research by Heath and Bryant (2000) marked this time when scholars adopted communication as a vehicle for understanding human behavior in the interpersonal field. Research trends in human communication through effective uncertainty reduction have improved the field.
