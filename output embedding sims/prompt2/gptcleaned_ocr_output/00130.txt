A language is, therefore, a language; it is essentially a tool for communication. It resists the modifications of social institutions and a system of values. It is the social part of a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one uses a language. A language is a system of contractual values that arise from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and a system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language to express their personal thoughts. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not a pure creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word dog in English or in Korean are external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "I propose to retain the word sign (signe) to designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifi√©) and signifier (signifiant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis (ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not in a destined relation, but rather, in an arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that "language does not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, "meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g., a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system" (Barker, 2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, let's consider the following sentence: "I went to a theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is established through the linear combination of signs.

The signs within the example, such as "theater," "my," and "girlfriend" can be substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She went to a restaurant and ate." According to Saussure, signs are operating when they "correspond to other signs." Crucially, signs do not make sense by reference to entities in an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each other. Thus, meaning is realized through the relations between signs" (Barker, C., 2002, p. 29). "It is central to note that red is meaningful in relation to the difference to green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
