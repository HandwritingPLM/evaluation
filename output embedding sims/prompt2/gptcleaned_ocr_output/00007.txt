It is well accepted that communication transcends the boundaries of disciplines. Over the past 10 years, the relationship between sociology and communication has been explored through research.

The exploration of gratifications through the empirical study of media consumption, such as daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944) revealed a list of functions served by the media. For instance, radio soap operas were found to provide entertainment, emotional support, and occasions for emotional release (Warner and Henry, 1948). Instead of simply offering information, newspapers were also discovered to be important in providing readers with a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and a structure to their daily routine (Berelson, 1949). These varied dimensions of usage satisfaction were marked by psychologist Herzog (1944) with the term "gratifications."

The uses and gratifications approach became prevalent in the late 1950s to 1970s as television grew in popularity. During that era, some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed. Among the scholars who focused on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz stood out and greatly contributed to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz served both as a sociologist and a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago. For the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, he was invited by the Government of Israel to lead the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting in Israel. This experience led to his subsequent academic work focused on broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication. In 1992, Katz joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania and directed its doctoral study.

One of the pioneers of gratifications research alongside Elihu Katz is Paul Lazarsfeld, who made important contributions connecting the concept of gratifications with the uses and gratification approach. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), they explored how individuals use the media to fulfill their needs, rather than the media overpowering them.

Overall, the research by scholars such as Blumler & Katz (1974) highlighted the importance of media in fulfilling the needs of users and serving as a means of cultural transmission for both society and individuals.
