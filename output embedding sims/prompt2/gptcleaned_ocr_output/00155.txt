Like many other structuralist scholars, Saussure considered language as a system of signs. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue consists of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material it covers; as opposed to it, speech (parole) is the purely individual part of language (Gatineau, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within a social dimension. The structure of langue is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not to a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is represented. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language; for example, sounds expressing the actual animal "dog." Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. The signifier (signifiant) and signified (signifi√©) designate the whole and replace the concept and sound-image; the last two terms have the advantage of leading to the whole of which they are parts (Saussure, 1959). Saussure argues that language does not reflect a pre-existent and external reference. According to Saussure, meaning is produced through a systematic organization and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic.

In the syntagmatic process, signs within a sentence are linearly combined to produce meaning. In the paradigmatic process, signs can be replaced with one another within the field of possible signifiers. Despite various possibilities in selecting signs, it is regulated by the consensus of the linguistic community. Signs generate meaning by reference to each other within a particular context. Saussure's argument lies in the influence which relations between signs have on the production of meaning.
