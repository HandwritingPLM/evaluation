Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level sees social convention or values shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. Vocabulary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, the fact that speech by an individual cannot be isolated from the 
A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language; it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not to a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "I propose to retain the word sign (signe) to designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifi√©) and signifier (signifiant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis (ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not in the destined relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation, but the difference between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that language does not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent OE, but constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences. According to him, meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along syntagmatic (e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g. a class) axes (Saussure, 2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or syntagmatic combinations comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic selection is also regulated by the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the following example: "She went to a restaurant with her girlfriend." This sentence is established through the linear combination of words. Some words such as theater, my, and girlfriend can be substituted for by one another, such as "She went to a restaurant with her mother." Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when they are related to each other, they generate meaning by reference to each other. Thus, an independent idea is realized through the relations between signs (Barker, 2009). Meaning is understood as a code; seen that red is meaningful in relation to the difference between red, green, and blue, and are then organized into a sequence which generates
between red, green, and blue.
