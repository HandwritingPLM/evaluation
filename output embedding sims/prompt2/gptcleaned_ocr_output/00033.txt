Uses and Gratifications

Motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. it was concluded that different People can use the same communication message in distinctly different ways.

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background such as education, affect People's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. There are as many reasons

experience, interests, and interactions to classify four important media problems; emotional release; identity: self-reference; reality seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then, he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotion stability of "growth" and "preservation." When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

Important media gratifications: (1) Diversion; (2) Personal relationships; identity exploration; value reinforcement; (3) Escape from routine or companionship; social utility; (4) Personal identities; and (5) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;

Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status;

Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and

Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.
