Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the public, and the oppositions (Lasswell, 1968) - necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing public opinion. Bernays (1955) himself made a statement highlighting the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies sane, managerial rather than artistic, creative, or emergent planning. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and press agentry. (Bernays, 1955, p. 22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea of aiming to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be commended and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of society but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts being made by others, and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of public opinion. Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point. 

Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that the public is able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more recent research that is meant to help understand the influence of the media on the public. With work by Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive theory of the media has been developed. The public has now been made aware of various media influences such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects that these techniques can have on their audiences. The theories presented in this paper have shown that scholars such as Bilal tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby media has sole control over the thought of the masses. Media may not have the only thought, but may also play a part in shaping it, providing a starting point for future research into the effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of Bernays as well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in this paper is important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and others have evolved over time, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today. 

The theories developed by Lippmann, Bernays, and Ellul have contributed significantly to both the direct effects and limited effects viewpoints, providing a deeper insight into the complexities of media influence and public opinion.
