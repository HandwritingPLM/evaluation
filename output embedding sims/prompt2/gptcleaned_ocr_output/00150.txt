Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to understand the Creation of. Ption the concept can be
examined chronologically, from its inception through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical reproduction of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno
became in effect Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin's death it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy. (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, operating there. The Nazis' rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would need to depart from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jurgen Habermas notes, the fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the experiences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p.

1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Adorno had little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and pleasantness increased during the 1930s, Adorno had little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and pleasantness increased during the 1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and counterculture developed during the 1930s, Adorno had little hope for popular culture.

Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio were popular entertainments under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay "The Regression in Listening" is in effect a pessimistic reply to Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." Benjamin believed that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, music was now inferior when reproduced on phonograph records. The result was that music now could be heard over the radio, and Adorno's condemnation of the mechanical reproduction was that it could destroy the listening experience and make escape from the whole of reality impossible. (Adorno, 2001b, 19s hical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of originality was the emancipation from hierarchical tastes. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction removed the potential for artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, it stripped away layers of imitation resembling Plato's essential form from the top—the original idea—to the destruction of authenticity. The general attitude of the essay argues that mechanical reproduction was nothing and Adorno was emphatic about the destruction of the aura leading to the establishment of a relationship.

Shortly after Adorno. In 1938, Max Horkheimer, seeing that the rise of the Nazi party in Germany had cost Adorno his job, began looking for a position in the United States. With the help of Columbia University, he was able to establish the Institute for Social Research and Radio Research in New York. Adorno, although hesitant at first, accepted the position and began working with Adorno, whom he considered to be an expert on the subject of radio. Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he believed that radio was only an image of a voice and that radio was only an image of a voice and he looked forward to
in 1941, reiterating his position that the medium was the Project's journal published by the radio industry. Additionally, he used the opportunity to work at the University in Schwann, and it was there that Adorno became friends. Adorno was shocked at the degree Benjamin was introduced, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno was Benjamin's only pupil. Since Benjamin never received a degree, Adorno decided to introduce Benjamin's ideas into academic philosophy. (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute after the rise of the Nazi party, and he began operating there. 

It can be understood that the idea of the culture industry as well as its necessary prerequisites began to develop.
