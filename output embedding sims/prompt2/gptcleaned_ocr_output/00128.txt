In 1954, Adorno published a book as a result of a study that had been done on the influence of rigid institutionalization and of psychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160). It was there that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it peculiar that the leading theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments (Adorno, 1954, p. 1). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape cultural industries. For example, in 1959 he wrote about a universal pseudo-culture in his book "The Culture Industry." Adorno conceded that film-making was an integral part of the culture industry, adding that this industry operated within a system of total control.

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Adorno and Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms within advanced industrial society ensured the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to maintain social control and continue to perpetuate it.

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions (Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass media as entities separate from the totality of dominant society. He wrote, "how an entity find a way! to break into their liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on a larger scale. Is it conceivable that they hope to liberate themselves from themselves, or even think of breaking free?" (Marcuse, 1991, p. 51). Given this, it is possible that he would be perceived as an icon for leftist movements.

Marcuse maintained that, in the face of this vicious circle, individuals within society have only agreed to republish and negotiate with Adorno and Horkheimer's work since pirate copies had already been produced. Adorno, theoretically, analyzed ideology in the same way that Adorno had done. In the end, Marcuse's analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant ideology. Marcuse argued for administered individuals who have adapted to the ideology in the same way that Adorno had done. In the end, Marcuse's analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant ideology.

Marcuse argued for administered individuals who have adapted to the ideology in the same way that Adorno had done. In the end, Marcuse's analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant ideology. Marcuse can be perceived as having a somewhat pessimistic tone. Ultimately, because of his academic background, and not being an activist, like others associated with the Frankfurt School, he was largely reported to Adorno. Adorno continued to revise and receive revision until his death in 1969, and may have had an influence on subsequent individuals.

In opposition to the dominant ideology, Marcuse contended that the administered individuals, who have adapted to the ideology, trapped in the pessimism of the book. It is somewhat reminiscent of the 1960s in the US, as he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others associated with the Frankfurt School, he was largely reported to Adorno. Adorno continued to receive revision and revision until his death in 1969, and may have had an influence on subsequent individuals.
