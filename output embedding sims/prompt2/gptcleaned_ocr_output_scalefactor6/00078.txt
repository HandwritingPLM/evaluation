Five basic assumptions were noted in short:
They provide a framework for understanding the

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of mass
gumption is the goal-oriented patterns of media use and shaped by a sense
defined expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience
Free.

2. The mass communication process much indicative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a significant limitation on
the theorizing about the pervasive effect of media content on attitudes and

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
this communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately addressed through mass media consumption

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves. i.e., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and tentative verbal formulation.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of this. Common ations should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms (pp. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although more studies on
Reward Alcoves detected individual gratifications that work people on the media. They did not address the
Connections between these gratifications. (Katz et al., 1974). They suggested that uses and grati-
fication research concern with following stages: (1) the social and psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) like media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
ferentiated exposure or engaging in other activities, resulting in (2) need gratification and (7) other
'Stray concerns, perhaps not yet completely clarified" (Katz et al., 1974, p20). The studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since
this is an ambitious aim and need. The current status of uses and
