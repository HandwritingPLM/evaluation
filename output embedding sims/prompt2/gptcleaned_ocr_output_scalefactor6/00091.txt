Uses and Gratifications

1.1 Introduction

In this chapter, we will discuss the concept of uses and gratifications in the field of media studies. This theory examines why people choose to consume certain media content and the gratifications they derive from it. By understanding these motivations, we can gain insights into the role of media in society and how it influences individual behavior. The uses and gratifications approach is important for analyzing the impact of media on audiences and the broader cultural landscape.
