Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Interpersonal communication has always been a strong foundation in the area of human interaction. It may be the key to understanding how individuals exchange, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty, fear, and anxiety. Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT), developed by Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), suggests that reducing uncertainty was a central objective of communication. Through the development of URT, scholars advanced the field of interpersonal communication by emphasizing its significant role in uncertainty reduction. According to Heath and Oram (XEN) "One of the motivations underlying interpersonal communication is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty" (p. 159). The exchange of information is fundamental to all forms of communication, yet in relation to the study of uncertainty in particular, advanced theoretical approaches in the field of interpersonal communication have flourished. URT plays a pivotal role in communication within interpersonal relationships, which was once overlooked in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Calabrese (1975) note "When communication scholars had conducted empirical research on the interpersonal communication process, they had been addressing how individuals gather, process, and exchange information in order to reduce uncertainty." The research underlying this theory and efforts made by contemporary scholars marked the advancement of interpersonal communication research. While early studies of human interaction had focused on a wide range of disciplines, research on interpersonal communication has made significant progress since the 1980s and has emphasized the central role of uncertainty in human interactions. The gathering of data on the development of interpersonal relationships is applied specifically to the field of interpersonal communication, addressing both practical and theoretical issues that arise as a result of relationships between individuals and groups.
