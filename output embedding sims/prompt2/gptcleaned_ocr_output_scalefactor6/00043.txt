i. Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication:

1.10 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduating, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1942 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger taught at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (San Francisco, 2008). Much of Festinger's research followed Lewin's influence and further developed his theories. Festinger's theories were highly influential in the field of interpersonal communication and the development of LRT.

Lewin's theories, as well as Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory (CDT), attempted to explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Festinger's CDT calls for three relationships among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other; and irrelevant relationships where cognitions have no connection to each other. Festinger believed that individuals seek to reduce cognitive dissonance and strive for consistency.

Festinger received several awards for his work, including the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychologica! Association. Festinger's influence can still be recognized in modern psychology and social science research. Festinger, 1980 stated, "It was in this era that Leo Festinger invested the better part of his career in developing his theory and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since." He especially praises St. Berger and Calabrese (1975) for their work on uncertainty. 

2. Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider was a German psychologist known for his work in social psychology. Heider studied at the University of Graz and the University of Berlin before moving to the United States to work at various institutions. Freud, Lewin, and Gestalt theorists influenced Heiderâ€™s work. In 1929, he moved to the United States for further research. In his work, Heider emphasized the importance of social perception and attribution theory. Heider's contributions to the field of social psychology have had a lasting impact on understanding interpersonal relationships.
