The Grier Propaganda Theorists

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

The initial research data reveal that the study is commissioned by The General Electric Company. It was conducted by T. Harold Lasswell, with the assistance of a sociologist and social psychologist.

According to Lasswell, the study of propaganda research serves a valuable purpose. It is concerned with the investigation of communication to ascertain its reliability and effectiveness.

It is further defined as, “.. the investigation of communications whose purpose is to persuade a target audience to adopt a particular opinion or course of action.” In analyzing propaganda, Lasswell focused on understanding the effects of the media on public opinion.

This interpretation suggests that propaganda can influence public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly interested in understanding the methods of creating propaganda. He suggested a method where the public is swayed in a particular direction.

Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was involved in examining publications, propaganda, and public opinion. In 1925, he wrote a book that analyzed the manipulation of public opinion by corporate entities. He stated, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.”

Informed by these ideas, Bernays posited that the key to successful public communication lies in understanding public opinion and being able to shape it effectively. This signifies the importance of clarity in making the public understand and appreciate the ideas being presented to them.
