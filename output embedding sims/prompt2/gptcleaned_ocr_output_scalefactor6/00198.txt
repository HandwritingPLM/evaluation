i. Needs and Gratifications

The use and gratifications approach emphasizes that people use media for different purposes, and Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people have different needs and seek different gratifications from the media.

People use various media content for different purposes. The same media content can be perceived differently by individuals. This is one way that people engage with the media as there are many factors influencing their interaction with media, such as their social background, experiences, education, and personal interests. Audience members are aware of and can satisfy their needs using different media content. Blumler and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “Uses and Gratifications” to identify four important media gratifications: (1) diversion from routine problems; (2) personal relationships and social welfare; (3) personal identity and social integration; and (4) surveillance of societal and global issues. These gratifications are influenced by individual needs and motives.

McQuail (1974) based on a general theory of human needs, distinguished between two types of needs: committed and affective. He then added three dimensions: "active vs. passive" involvement, "internal vs. external" goal orientation, and recognition of the stability of "gain" and "preservation". When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations that apply to media use (Figure 1).

McQuail (1974) also structured patterns of human motivation, which were further developed by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) into 25 media needs clustered into five categories.

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding.
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, and feelings.
3. Personal integrative needs, including escapism, self-esteem, and social integration.
4. Social integrative needs, including companionship, social interaction, and entertainment.
5. Tension release needs, including escape and relaxation.

Similarly, McQuail (1963) outlined the following common reasons for media use:

- Finding out about recent events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world.
- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision-making.
- Satisfying curiosity and general interest.
- Leisure and entertainment.
- Aiming for a sense of security through predictability.
- Finding reinforcement for personal values.
- Finding models of behavior.
- Hanging out with valued others in the media environment.
- Passing time or alleviating boredom.
