NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows:

Primary premise 2: The key for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

The audience 1 Corere eeca es ecile, Le an Loria! faeT t Mees mechwoe is
ISSUE to be pitfall eed... ASPECTS of media use are shaped by more often than
definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience
member.

In the mass communication process, initiative and need for gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on audiences a
whole.

The tie-in with other sources of need satisfaction: The needs served by
THESE COMMUNICATION contribute only a segment of the wider area of human needs,
and the extent to which they can be adequately met can get things and consumption
certainly varies.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media Can Be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- i.e., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to interpret their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least recognize them when they are confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
supplemented while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (pp. 15-17)

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also DID come up with Previous researches on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that affect people on the media. They did not lack what
connections between these gratifications. They underscored that needs and gratifications research concern with the following aspects: "1) the social and the psychological origins of (2) needs which generate (4) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) differential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones." The studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of broadening the uses and gratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been seen hide and seeks. The areas of uses and
gratifications is still because Katz's first analysis, particularly as New Media Forms have emerged in

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived mias of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the mass communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may satisfy different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the same content as there are users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).
