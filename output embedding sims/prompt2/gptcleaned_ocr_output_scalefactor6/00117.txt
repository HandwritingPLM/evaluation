Rogers was born in Caneel, Iowa in 1931. He earned his BA, MA, and PhD degrees from Lawrence University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, in 1984, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Rome.

He has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and its applications of diffusion theory in such fields as geography, commerce, psychology, political science, and, as previously mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Peleceton in 2004 because he was suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2004.

According to Rogers (1953), diffusion refers to "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation can be an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels." (p. 409)

That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass communication, people can get information on an innovation and perceive the innovation as useful. Laswell (1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-E-I: sender-message-channel-receiver-effect. Rogers (1962) mentioned, "this S-M-C-E communication model corresponded chiefly to the elements of diffusion." Specifically, (1) sender can be innovators or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a rare idea or practical, (3) Channel can be interpersonal or mass media, (4) receivers can be members of a certain system, and finally (5) the effect can be individuals' adoption of social change. In the diffusion theory, "Time" variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1962), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1) the innovation-decision process (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovationâ€™s rate of adoption. Most innovations show an S-shaped curve of adoption. Rogers describes how opinion leaders and early adopters are the first ones to adopt, while late majority and laggards are at a later stage.

There are five different types of adopter in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness: (1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (deliberate), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional). Rogers defined his term as "the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting a new idea than other members of his social system." Figure 1 shows the relationship between types of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories follow a standard deviations curve which is bell-shaped, skewed by new, old, and repeat adopters in diffusion. Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in a S-shaped curve. However, since different types of innovation exist, the rate of adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed corn, however, decision differential rates is different. Figure.

When it comes to the process of implementation-decision, Pepper (1955) mentioned that there are five stages:

1. Knowledge: collective exposure of awareness of innovations
2. Persuasion: people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations
3. Adoption (Decision: people decide to adopt the innovation
4. Implementation: regular or standard practices
5. Confirmation: comparing and evaluating
