Uncertainty Reduction

1) Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorist

Since the twentieth century, the concept of information has been a significant foundation for communications research with the development of communication theory. Information exchange and better human interaction based on such exchanged information helps in reducing uncertainty. Uncertainty reduction theory was formulated and introduced by Charles Berger and Richard Calabrese in 1972, emphasizing the importance of reducing uncertainty in communication. Through the development of URT, they revolutionized the field of interpersonal communication by providing a solid and reliable base for uncertainty research. Heath and Heath (2000) state, "One of the key factors underlying interpersonal communication is the question of information with which to reduce uncertainty" (p. 53). The study of information is crucial in all communication fields, but it's especially essential to address uncertainty in interpersonal communication. URT plays a crucial role in placing communication at the core, which is a significant step in the development of interpersonal communication. Berger and Calabrese (1975) claim, "As communication researchers have engaged in research on interpersonal communication processes, they've begun to draw on formal psychological theories as a basis for explaining them." The research exploring the foundations and theories laid by communication researchers marked the emergence of interpersonal communication research; with the development of URT, researchers began to look at communication through theoretical approaches, integrating practical applications into the field.

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Historically, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field. Interpersonal communication is often associated with relationships, conflict, and social change. Prior to the 1850s, only a limited amount of research was conducted under the category of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant (2000) defined this period as the genesis of the field of interpersonal communication: "Practically since 1901, scholars have used communication as a central theme because they noticed that it was both scientifiable and accessible to heterogeneous audiences" (p. 29). The early research influenced the development of an interdisciplinary field focused on studying individual behavior and the impact of relationships. As communication patterns were not just a result of personal characteristics but also influenced by societal trends and advancements in communication technology, it was perceived that relational quality could be enhanced through effective communication strategies.
