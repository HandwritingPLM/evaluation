Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the perceived needs of audience members. Blumer and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content can gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumer & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individualâ€™s background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet these needs. That is, audience members are unique and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumer, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: (i) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivision of the audience's motivations was developed by Perse et al. (1994), based on a general theory of human needs. They distinguished between two types of "appe cognitive and affective. Then they added three dimensions: achievement versus passive initiation, external versus internal goal orientation, and emotional stability of growth and preservation. These factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to the structure of 16 general paradigms of human orientation (McGuire, 1974). Katz and Foulkes (1973) developed 35 items taken from the social and psychological functions of the media and grouped them into five categories.

Cognitive needs, including information, orientation, learning and excitement.

Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, escape, and relaxation.

Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, and status.

Social integrative needs, including integration and social interaction.

Personal identity needs, including reality exploration, value reinforces, and confirmation of self-worth.

Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Television's basic needs, including relaxation, entertainment, and companionship.

In conclusion, the findings suggest that media provide a sense of security and help individuals in decision making, practicing social interaction, and fulfilling personal and social needs, as well as in understanding and predicting behavior of others.
