Water management is an important task for many, and one area of specific concern is the ageing of concrete structures. The ageing of concrete is a major issue in civil engineering, with a potential impact on public safety. One key way to mitigate this issue is by designing more durable and sustainable structures. However, the process of aging can be complex and requires careful consideration of various factors. In this study, the authors explore the potential benefits of using a new type of concrete, which is known as 'PHAGE.' The results show that PHAGE offers significant advantages in terms of durability and sustainability compared to traditional concrete materials. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of developing innovative solutions to address the challenges of aging infrastructure.
