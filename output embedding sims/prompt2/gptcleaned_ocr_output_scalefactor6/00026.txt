Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

The search for explaining the great appeal of media is a core question of such research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McGuail, 1983). There exists a basic idea in this approach that people look for content, need which media they can use to meet their needs. In the communication process, the uses and gratifications approach puts the function of linking need gratification and media choice squarely on the side of audience members. It suggests that people’s needs influence what media they would choose, how they use certain media, and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active participants who actively seek information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus on “what media do to people” and assume audiences are homogeneous, the uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with “what people do with media” (Katz, 1959). It relates audiences’ personal needs to their use of media and how they respond to the media, which is determined by their social and psychological background. The uses and gratifications approach also posits that the media compete with other information sources for audience's highest satisfaction (Katz et al., 1974a). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different media. The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing their reasons for choosing certain media over others, as well as the various gratifications they derive from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin & Tankard, 1997). As a broader perspective among media theories, it provides a framework for understanding the processes by which audiences select content effectively (Katz et al., 1974). Audience members then incorporate the gathered content to satisfy their interests (Lowery & Nabila, 1992).

1.2 Origin and History
Media theories have developed through the years with contributions from valuable researchers as well as diverse fields such as psychology and sociology. It is well accepted that communication has been at the intersection of these disciplines, exploring more unified fields in these diverse areas of understanding media. Researchers have been instrumental in unraveling the complex interdisciplinary nature of media theory.
