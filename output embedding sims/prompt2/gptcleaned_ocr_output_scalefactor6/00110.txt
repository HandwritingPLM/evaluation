Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Dewey are important for a number of reasons. Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that the public can be influenced by media, The work of Lippmann and Dewey helped to reveal new ways of understanding the influence of media on the public. Through the work of Bernays, Lewin, and McGee and Segal, a more comprehensive understanding of the media has been developed. The public has adapted to new forms of media such as social media, blogging, and potential effects of new technologies.

The theories presented in this paper are tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited specific propaganda could have on the thoughts of the public. While the theories of Lippmann are novel in the idea that the media might be influencing collective thought, they may also be influenced by what people believe. It was this line of thinking that resulted in the beginning of public relations by Bernays and Weber, as well as McCorkindale and Shay. The research of the scholars discussed in the paper is very important in the understanding of the media, the economy, and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Dewey are not always easily understood, they all contribute to a better understanding of the ways in which media can influence the public opinion.
