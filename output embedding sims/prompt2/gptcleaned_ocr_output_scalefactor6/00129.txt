COMMISSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing public opinion (Bernays, 1955). Bernays makes a statement regarding his career, the engineering of consent. He adds, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from older hit of mere publicity and propaganda (Bernays, 1928). Furthermore, Bernays' theories also represent a different view of the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this, like him. The public is not an amorphous mass which can be molded at will or derived to (Bernays, 1928). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in attempting to influence the public, a business must act steadily with terms that establish the partnership to be fair, amicable, and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the public in terms which the public can understand and be willing to accept.

Bernays elaborates on these in Public Relations (1960). Rather than overtly attempting to mislead the public through propaganda, Bernays prevents public deception by providing a tool that can be used in combining the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objectives and principles of public relations can help the client adjust to the contemporary highs, or help the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1933). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, it recognizes the power of society, but also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Within this framework, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not to the extent of ignorance of the public opinion. This is where Lippman and Bernays tended to disagree with this point.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories.

The themes developed by Lippmann, Bernays, and others are important for our understanding of issues, based on the ideas of their predecessors. Research on the influence of the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has been critical research to understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the work of Yeager, Kiander, and others, a new understanding of the media has been developed. The paper delves into the direct effects and indirect efforts resulting in progress. The theories presented in this paper are tied closely to show the direct effects and unintended consequences. The research of the scholars discussed in this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public, and the democratization of public opinion. While the theories of Lasswell, Lerner, Rosener, and Ellul were developed long ago, they continue to be relevant in shaping our society.
