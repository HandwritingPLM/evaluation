Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics.

Language operates on two levels, the systematic system and variation.

Language is the systematized set of the material of the signal which composes individual parts of language” (Barthes, 1967, the social dimension. The structure level, language, is the social convention or value shared throughout a society which is stabilized and standardized.

The actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from it.

On the contrary, parole is feasible because it is

A language is therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is essentially a collaborative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not a pure creator. (Barthes, 1947, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts. The signified and the signifier, The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Hence, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "I propose to retain the word sign (signe) to designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifie) and signifier (signifiant); the last-named terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are part." (Saussure, 1909, in RB. ines (edit, p. 37). The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not in the destined explanation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference.

between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1959) argues that language does not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, But constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences. According to Saussure, “meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic axis (e.g. a sequence) and the paradigmatic axis (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system” (Barker, p. 28). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sequence and the paradigmatic a set of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the name Here the deletion is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, let us consider the following sentence: “I went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the linear combination of signs. The signs within the sequence, such as theater, my, and girlfriend can be substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She went to a restaurant with her mother.” Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operative only when they are related to each other. Fundamentally, signs do not make sense by virtue of referring to entities in an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each other. Thus, meaning is understood as a cultural convention organized through the relation between signs” (Barker, C., 2004, p. 2. "We is central to Saussure's argument: e,e, & meaningful in relation to the difference between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
