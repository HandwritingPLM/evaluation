1 Needs and Gratifications

The gratifications approach emphasizes that media and the well-perceived needs of the audience. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may have different uses for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. On the contrary, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their requirements and gratifications for using media. Blumler and Brown (1977) proposed a model of "media-person interaction" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (4) Personal identity: self-reinforcement; reality exploration; value expression; and (21 Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McClelland (1972), based on a Needs Theory of human motivation. He distinguished between two kinds of need: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" media, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotion stability of "growth" and "maintenance." When combined, these factors yield 16 different types of gratifications which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1A illustrates a grouping of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McClelland, 1972). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the media and placed them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and intellectual curiosity.

2. Affective needs, including aesthetic, pleasurable, and emotional experiences.

3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability of beliefs.

4. Social (interpretive) needs, including integration of culture and building relationships.

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Accordingly, McQuail's (1987) classification of the televiewing common elements focuses on finding out about relevant news and events in worldwide surroundings, formulating and sharing opinions, and making decisions:

- seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision-making choices
- satisfying curiosity and general knowledge

- seeking a sense of security through nervous help
- reading primary books for personal satisfaction

- finding a model of behavior
- identifying with valued themes in the media
- generating ideas in one's mind.
