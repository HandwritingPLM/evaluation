Other Propaganda Theorists
1.0 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Ciggrmann was studying propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann and Bernays.

Harold Lasswell (1978) was a pioneer in the field of converting the moralities and qualities and sources of propaganda, and ascertaining the effects of propaganda on the mass world audience (Pfleger, 1) in the mass communication procedures of content analysis (Rogers, 4). Generally, content analysis can be defined as "the measurement of communicative behaviors by categorizing the content in classes to observe certain variables" (Rogers, 1964) in what Rogers termed "Concepts of Communication." Lasswell (1948) explained that a content analysis had to take into account the specificity with which camera angles appear on television, the direction in which a story is presented to propaganda, the scene’s style, and the regularity of the symbolic use. By understanding the content of other message sources, Lasswell was also able to achieve the goal of understanding the "range of influences that flow from content to content and from content to audience."

This method of communication leads directly to Lasswell’s (1952) early definitions of communication which stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom under what circumstances with what effect." Content analysis was essentially the same as what Lasswell had defined, and Lasswell was to do a lot of work within this area during the next years and his career.

Aside from understanding the communal propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion via media, and also approaching it conceptually. However, Lasswell believes that information that is offering their decision within is information that is being censored.

Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda, Edward Bernays was engaging public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1924) defines propaganda as, "A concerted, organized effort to influence the public with the regards to the relations between the public and an enterprise, idea, or group." Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bernays believed that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think or alter the opinions of individuals but this may actually be beneficial to society.

Bernays pursued his work in the field of public relations, "Public relations acts, by information, persuasion, and communication strategies and relies on public opinion," and he sees it as "informing, enlightening, and convincing public opinion."

Lastly, F. Aber (1955) highlighted the importance of understanding the public and developing a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relations campaign is adjustment of the campaign to the attitudes of various groups in society, gathering information to effectively express one's idea, and ultimately, willing to influence the public opinions in the desired direction.

Bernays' work was a huge step forward for mass communication theory. They move away from the typical perceptions of "harmless propaganda" and instead built a foundation.
