Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition of media research. The original conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of certain media contents. The core question of mass research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1992) There exists a basic idea in this approach that people choose content, and which media they use reflects their needs and preferences.

The approach challenges what traditional media studies suggest in that it regards audiences as active participants rather than passive consumers of information. In contrast to traditional media studies that ask "what media do people use" and assume audiences are passive, uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). It relates personal needs to media use and responds to those needs, which can be influenced by social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates that some people are more active media consumers and engage in a wide range of media platforms and content, in contrast to the passive audiences stated in traditional perspectives. Audiences are seen to be empowered in different ways, as they ascertain their motivations for using media. This approach has an unyielding focus on media audiences and the motivations that drive media consumption.

The classifications have evolved through time and encompass a wide array of uses and gratifications that vary in disciplinary perspectives. Researchers aim to understand media audiences in assessing media use in their everyday lives, as well as how media influence society and culture.
