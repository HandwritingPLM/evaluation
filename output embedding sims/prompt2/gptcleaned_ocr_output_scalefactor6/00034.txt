Uses and Gratifications

1. Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tract in media research. The original conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of Can Mad Conk. The core question of such research being: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1974). There is a basic idea in this approach: AUDIENCES must know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.

In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of linking needs, gratifications, and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use certain media, and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users who rely on what media do for them and assume audiences are heterogeneous, uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with what people do with media (Field, 1952), Malina audiences predict media and respond to the media, which is determined by their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also posits that the media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Rosengren et al., 1974a). As traditional mass media and fan media continue to provide a large variety of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different media. This approach emphasizes audiencesâ€™ choice by analyzing their reasons for using certain media to the disregard of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained from the media based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin & Tankard, 1997). A broader perspective from COM uses a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants gather information and content selectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Pasquier et al., 1976). Audience members then incorporate the content fully into their messages.

It is accepted that communication theories have developed through the amalgamation of PARADIGMATIC and epistemological inquiry over the past 10 years. With the more unified frameworks in these two disciplines, researchers are better equipped to develop higher conceptions of understanding media.
