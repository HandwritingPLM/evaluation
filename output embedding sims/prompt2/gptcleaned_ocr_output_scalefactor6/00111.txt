Uncertainty Reduction

Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabresc, and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of Uncertainty Reduction has been a cornerstone for communication research and the development of communication theory. Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), focuses on reducing uncertainty in the study of human communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars have greatly influenced the field of interpersonal communication by highlighting the importance of uncertainty reduction in interpersonal interactions. According to Berger, Heath, and Bryan (2000), "the motivations underpinning URT explain the intricacies of information acquisition with which individuals reduce uncertainty" (p. 1). The study of communication is evolving into a field of "communicating well", and its relation to the study of uncertainty is particularly advanced theoretically. Within the field of interpersonal communication, URT plays a key role in the development of the field of communication. Berger and Calabrese (1975) point out that when communication scholars have conducted empirical research on interpersonal communication and social relationships, they have focused on interpersonal behaviors and the impact of psychological theories as "starting points" (p. 1). The research underlying the theory and further research by other scholars has led to an emergence of interest in interpersonal communication.

The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as the fundamental core of human relationships - the key to interacting effectively in personal and professional settings. Communication scholars have identified communication as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication research. Heath and Heesen (2000) regarded the work of Shannon and Weaver as the foundation of the field of communication. They argued that, ultimately, the challenge became the progression towards effective communication. An early pivotal research study that aided the understanding of communication was conducted by Shannon and Weaver, focusing on the concepts of information and communication accuracy. The study demonstrated that relationships are built on mutual perceptions and the accuracy of information, indicating that relationships could be enhanced.
