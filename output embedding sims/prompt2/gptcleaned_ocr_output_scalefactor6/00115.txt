i. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1. Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people use the same media content may for very different purposes. The same media content may grate different moods for different
Inn Gua. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people’s ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications
for using different media, Behyail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
Interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance: forms of infor-
mation seeking.

Another subtitled variation on the audience's motivation was suggested by Fiske (1974), based

on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” mediation, “external versus
internal” goal orientation, and orientation stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 4
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motte (McQuail et al., 1972). Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch
(1979) developed 25 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
out their five gate oxen:

- Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;
- Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;
- Personal IIVATEE needs, including creativity and intellectual stimiou;
- Soci integrative needs, including developing relationships with family and friends, and
- Tension releaie needs including relaxation, escape or cers action.

Klapper's (1965) classification of uses is follows:

- Understanding and finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society and the world;
- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinions and decision choices;
- Satisfying curiosity and material interest;
- Amusement and escapism;
- Maintaining a sense of security through knowledge;
- Finding reinforcement for personal worth, skills, or values;
- Finding models of behavior;
- Emulating valued others in the media;
- Identifying with characters;
- Releasing pent-up emotion.
