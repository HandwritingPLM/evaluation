The Test

The ability assists in the recruitment and selection process Â· Making it more objective and minimising the impact of personal biases.

The test itself is not suitable for all applicants, and a decision about who is fit or unfit for a job should not be based solely on the results of the test. Instead, the results should be used in combination with other information, such as interviews and references, to make an informed decision.

Overall, the test can be a useful tool in the recruitment process, but it should not be the sole basis for making a hiring decision.
