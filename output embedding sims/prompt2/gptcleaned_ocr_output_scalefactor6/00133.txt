Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

The 1927 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the Culture Industry outside of a German context. In the years since, there have been numerous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about "the commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the generally sympathetic Deborah Gole, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production, and failed to examine the Culture Industry's economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Osborne, 1995, p. 46). Believing that "capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive commercial culture" (Pep, 1992, p. 46), Terry Eagleton conceded that "the distinction of canonic values and personal creativity from commercial pressures on people is an embryonic idea" (Eagleton, 1992, p. 28). The concept of a culture industry was historically intimidating, as the media went beyond the Culture Industry. While the idea of the culture industry has had an important impact on critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, it has helped to think about the role of mass communications in contemporary society. Since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about the sources and aims of the culture industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. Yet movies are still made by large companies and their contents help shape societal norms. It is also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by a small number of conglomerates, which tend to impose restrictions on how stations can broadcast content. While the existence of the culture industry may be necessary in order to focus on how mass communication media propagate dominant ideologies.
