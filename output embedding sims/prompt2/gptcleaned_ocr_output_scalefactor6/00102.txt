1. Needs and Gratifications

The Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of the audience. Mueller and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may have different effects for different individuals. There is yet another way that people use media. Contrarily, there are many reasons for engaging with the media. There are numerous media works (Blumler & Katz, 1971).

Basic needs, social evaluation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's desires about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their core motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Sumner, and Brow (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interaction" that identifies four important media gratifications: [1] Diversion: escape from routine or programs; emotional release; [2] Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; [3] Personal identity and reference; cognitive euphemism; value reinforcement; and [4] Surveillance (forms of information seeking) (see Fig. 1).

Another subdivision of the audience's motivation was suggested by Pacileone (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: Cognitive and affective. Then he attached three criteria: "external" goal orientation, action orientation, and emotion stability or preservation. When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of gratifications which apply to media use (Figure 1). A further ranking of 14 general conditions of human motivation was proposed by McGuire (1978). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs based on the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding.
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, and excitement.
3. Personal integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends.
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends.
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Additionally, McQuail's (1974) examination of the following core reasons for media use:

- Finding out about important events and issues.
- Finding immediate surroundings, past and the present.
- Seeking advice on personal matters or opinion and decision-making.
- Identifying with perceived authority figures.
- Learning for self-education.
- Maintaining a sense of social belonging.
- Identifying with like-minded others in the media.
- Gaining insight or new perspectives.
