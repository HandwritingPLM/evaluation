1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the perceived needs of audience members.
Jay G. Blumler and Elihu Katz concluded that different people consume the same communication content for various gratifications. The mass media content may serve different needs for different individuals.

Nevertheless, there is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many uses for using the media as there are users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic attitudes, social status, and the individual’s background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best suit their needs. Thus, audience members are aware of and can state their desires for gratification for using different media. Jay G. Blumler and Denis McQuail, and Joseph Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Information stage from routine or problems: cognitive release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social enjoyment; (3) Personal identity: self-realization; reality exploration; self-reinforcements; and (4) Surveillance (flows of information): sense making.

A seminal study regarding the audience's imagination was done by PALS in 1972, based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between three types of needs: cognitive, affective, and tension. Then he added three dimensions: “external world” versus “internal world,” “external goal orientation” versus “internal goal orientation,” and emotional stability of “production and "consumption.” When combined, these factors yield 16 different types of motives which apply to media use. Ane 1. A Social Ring of 16 General Gratifications of Mass Communication (Mitsui 1984). Later, Gunewitch and Maer (1979) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into four categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding
2. Affective needs, including amusement, pleasure, feelings
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status
4. Societal integrative needs, including connecting with family and friends, role performance

Consequently, McQuail’s (1995) classification of the underlying common reasons for media use includes:

- Finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world
- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinions on decision choices
- Gratifying curiosity and general interest
- Fulfilling relaxation needs
- Gaining a sense of security through knowledge
- Finding reinforcement for personal values
- Finding models of behavior
- Identifying with valued others in the media
- Gaining insight into oneself
