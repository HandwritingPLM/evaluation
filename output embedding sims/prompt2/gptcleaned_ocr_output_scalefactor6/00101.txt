Uses and Gratifications

1. Introduction

The uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the appeal of certain media contents. The core question of such research is, "Why do people use media and what do they use them for?" (OCR, 196%). There is a basic idea in this approach: audience members know media content, and which media are involved in the mass communication process. Uses and gratifications approach puts the function of linking real gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. Successive research focuses on what media they would choose, how they use certain media, and what gratifications the media give them. The approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to mere receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus on what media does to people and assume audiences are passive, Uses and Gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). It allows personal needs to influence media consumption and responds to individual audience members' social and psychological backgrounds. Uses and gratifications approach also acknowledges that media compete with other information sources for audience's attention and considers both traditional mass media and new media sources to provide valuable content. It is considered one of the most appropriate
