Early Influence

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication. The influence of their work can best be reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1974).

1.00 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduating, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but then followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and the development of UBT. Festinger is best known for his theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) aimed to explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect a perceived. Lewin's work contributed to CDT in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1957). CDT allows for three possible relationships with each other, a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other, and irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect MCT (West, 2006). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an effect on events that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory suggests that individuals compare themselves to others similar to the well-being of success and result in conformity pressures (Thoehak & Formes, 2004). Berger and Calabrese expanded on social comparison theory by stating that "Festinger proposed a principle that enforces the concept that individuals seek to reduce discrepancies between their experiences with their thoughts" (p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished Scientist Award of the American Psychological Association for his theoretical contributions.

Stanford University and later the University of
Hania earned his doctorate in psychology from the Hilton Rowen Institute. Lewin, like Festinger, greatly influenced much of my thinking and which a lot of my research stems directly from his work." (Hees, 2004, p. 8).
