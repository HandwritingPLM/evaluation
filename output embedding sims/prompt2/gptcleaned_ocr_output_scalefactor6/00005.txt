Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1908. During the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, he worked on family planning communication.

The bank, has become a standard textbook on diffusion theory and interests a wide range of applications beyond the theory in such fields as general science, human geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was diagnosed with kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1908), diffusion refers to the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or another unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels (p. 2). That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass communication, people can get information of an innovation and perceive the innovation as useful. Lind (1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-R-E (e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect. Rogers (1985) mentioned, "this S-M-C-R-E communication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion" (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally (5) the effects can be individuals' adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, the "time" variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (SL, this variable is involved in the diffusion milieu, the innovation-decision process, an innovation's rate of adoption. Different innovations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion theory borrows characteristics from other theories such as the Okc model found often in innovation adoption and theory. Additionally, there is an overlap in the components of innovation diffusion with interpersonal influences of important conforming voluntarism to the institutional or normative behavior. Also, there is considerable theoretical support for the proposed pentahedron. In any social system, the most proper place for an idea may be precisely where it is initially resisted.

There are five categories in which individuals divide when adopting behavior:
1) Innovators
2) Early Adopters
3) Early Majority
4) Late Majority
5) Laggards

Rogers defined innovators as venturesome, early adopters as respected, early majority as deliberate, late majority as skeptical, and laggards as tradition-bound. Rogers suggested that innovators and early adopters are earlier in adopting new ideas than other members of the social system (Rogers, 1983, p. 11). Individuals motivated by innovativeness are eager to take risks. They wish to appear as trendsetters and enjoy the image of being thought leaders among peers. Motivated by respect, early adopters are more discreet about their adoption choices and take advantage of their social status for influence. Early majority members are guided by prudence, careful about their choices, and get motivated by the need for social acceptance. Late majority are skeptical about innovation, wait for others to test it first. Laggards, in contrast, are traditional and passive, skeptical of changes to existing social structures. they are more concerned about the past than the future.

In summary, the adoption-decision process involves five stages:
1. Knowledge (exposure or awareness of new idea)
2. Persuasion (forming a favorable attitude towards the new idea)
3. Decision (taking the next step to adopt the new idea)
4. Implementation (putting the new idea into practice)
5. Confirmation (seeking reinforcement and evaluations of the decision made).
