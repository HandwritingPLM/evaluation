Defining Uncertainty

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on parent,
social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of beaming, distance balance,
and reactance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2006). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology,
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of scholars
as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the century
and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Gilles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Rees (2005) state: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research
landscape over the past few decades.” (p. 234). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on the dyad: communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since the 1980s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This paper strives to acknowledge
those pioneers who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our
understanding of interpersonal processes.
