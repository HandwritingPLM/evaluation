Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1 Harold Lasswell (1907-1975)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was developing a theory of communication. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself.

Harold Lasswell (1900-1972) was another key figure in the area of propaganda research. He focused on understanding the mechanisms of propaganda.

Lasswell can also be credited with creating an early framework for analyzing the effects of propaganda. Generally, communication analysis can be defined as the investigation of communication processes by categorizing signals, in order to reason certain variables.Similarly, in an analog textual representation analysis, one seeks to decipher the direction in which the integrity of the symbols used. By understanding the connections between symbols, the goal is to comprehend the flow of influence that moves from content to content and shapes content.

This rational analysis is significant because, with an early understanding, it can reveal the channels and media through which and with the help of which the best approaches can be applied to create public opinion. It is not only with well-founded attention that communication experts create and maintain a campaign for shaping public opinion. This is why Lasswell has developed a model, according to which the public is limited in the information presented to them and is also hesitant to accept it. However, he goes on to elaborate on how this can be overcome by presenting information in a way that the public is more willing to accept.

Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was another key figure who recognized the power of propaganda in influencing public opinion. Bernays was influential in using propaganda techniques to shape public opinion. He believed that public opinion could be heretical or heretical in the public, but it could, in turn, shape the world in a direction that is influenced by the parties. Bernays believed that our minds are manipulated, our ages distorted, our ideas suggested, mainly by those who wanted us to live according to the norm.

Based on this, rather than purely rational thinking, Bernays argued that it is essential to address the emotions and feelings that lead individuals to act in certain ways. By understanding and manipulating these emotions, public relations can effectively influence public opinion, shaping it in the desired direction. This highlights the importance of adjusting campaigns to suit the audience's psychological tendencies, thereby leveraging emotions and feelings to influence public opinion effectively.
