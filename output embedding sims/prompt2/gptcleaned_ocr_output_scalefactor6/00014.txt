DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2015). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Newinger, Hildre, Brehov, and Hewie. By the 1980s, research interests began shifting into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Mehrabian, Elias, Taylor, Beck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Flanagan, Holloff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Bourges, and Patterson. Berger (2005) stated: "These early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past two decades" (p. 406). Today, interpersonal communicating indeed faces an added communication, comprising inhibiting face-to-face interaction of communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory yet called focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been specifically scrutinized that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on those scholars who pioneered the presence of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is central to our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important concept, necessary for the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concern originated, and how it has been defined and studied. The way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1948) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high demand of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal, hence raising the level of uncertainty. The concentration of uncertainty on the density of things. but the theoretical framework of uncertainty lies waggers their work and contributed to the development of LRT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from their investigation theories as well as Heider (1948) research in the area. Berger and Calabrese (1975) defined uncertainty in interpersonal communication by identifying uncertainty as the "number of alternative ways in which each participant might behave" (p. 10). The greater the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behavior and occurrences, creating avoidance and individuals are faced with problems or deciding preferences and possible belief, not only explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac's (1992) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say." Uncertainty plays a significant role when interacting with strangers. High levels of uncertainty can adversely inhibit places and people. Unfortunately, individuals and communicators who lack certainty in their relationships cannot fully develop relationships or may be too afraid to engage in meaningful interactions. West and Turner (2006) note that lower levels of uncertainty are correlated with neutral and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of liking, and increased liking. They conclude civilly with the explanation that "Too much certainty and predictability can hinder a relationship.
