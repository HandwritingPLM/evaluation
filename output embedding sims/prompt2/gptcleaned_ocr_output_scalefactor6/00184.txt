Uses and Gratifications

1.4 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents. The key question of such research is: Why do people use media
and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1980) There exists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and within which media they can use to meet their needs
in the mass communication process. Uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking needs gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members,
so that people’s needs influence what media they would choose, how they use certain media, and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to
passive receivers of information, but countersal theories which focus
on “what media do to people” which assume audiences are homogeneous, needs and gratifications
approach is more concerned with “what people do with media” (Katz 1955), and how
audiences personalize media and responds to the media, which is determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also posits
that the media compete with other information sources in audience's need satisfaction (Rafael
et al. 1974a). As traditional media and new media continues to provide people with a
wide range of media platforms and content, this considered one of the most appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be engaged in different.
The emphasizes audiences' choice by assessing their reasons for using
a certain media to the degree of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained
from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Sereda
& Tancer, 1972). Therefore perhaps it is also compelling for researchers to comprehend the processes by which some participants seek
information or content selectively, consistent with individual psychological states

social and psychological requirements (Sereda
& Tancer, 1972). Therefore perhaps it is also compelling for researchers to comprehend the processes by which some participants seek
information or content selectively, consistent with individual psychological states and needs (Lowery & DeFleur, 1963).

1.2 Origin and History

It is well acknowledged that communication theories have developed through the realms of psy-
chology and sociology over the past 100 years. With valuable insights gained from these disciplines, researchers can have a better
understanding of communication and media.
