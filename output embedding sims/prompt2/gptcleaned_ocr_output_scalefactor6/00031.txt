T ApEDS AND GRAtIFicatIoNS

1. Needs and Gratifications

Lees and Katz argued that people may use the same communication media for very different purposes. The same media content may have different meanings for different individuals. There is not a one-to-one map between people and media. On the contrary, there are various reasons for using the media and there are different types of media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, are people's basis for what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their motives and gratifications for using different media. Palmgreen, Rayburn, and Brean (1982) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or stress; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-esteem; role models; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance [forms of information-seeking.

Another subdivided version of the audience motivation was suggested by Mosakre (1974) based on a person's levels of needs and affect. Then he added three dimensions: "active versus passive" modes, "external and internal" goal orientation, and emotion stability of "growth" and "maintenance" when changed, these choices yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use [Figure 1. Figure 1. A system of 16 psychological paradigms of human motivation (Bird, 1974). Berelson, Gunncih and Hayes (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the Mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and such things.

2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings.

3. Personal integrative needs, establishing credibility, self-esteem.

4. Societal integrative needs, including interacting with society and friends; and

5. Tension release needs, including relief of stresses.

Congruously, Metcalf's (1960) classification of the following common reasons for media use include:

finding out about relevant events and current affairs, either immediately local or far reaching, somewhere or right now;
making decisions of practical matter: opinion and decision choices;
satisfying curiosity and general interest;
beginning a search;
gaining a sense of security through knowing facts;
directing entertainment for pleasurable returns;
changing modes of behavior;
identifying with valued others in the medial
