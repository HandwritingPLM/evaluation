Defining Uncertainty

Research conducted under the umbrella of interpersonal communication initially focused on
social influence, and small group practices. Theories explored the role of behavior, appearance,
social judgment, and acceptance (Barger, 75). Kurt Lewin, a pioneer of social psychology,
emphasized development and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such greats
as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the
and into the LSB, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Pantalp, Relot!, and Berger
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Gales, Hurgoon, and Panarsoe.
Berger (2006) states “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal COMA
agenda during the past nine decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication is a focus
on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, of communication as a
function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been
found that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is essential for
understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty
Since uncertainly has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communi-
cation, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1948) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation
when there were a high amount of possible alternatives and the probabilities of their occurrence were relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adapted concepts from the
information theories as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining it as
the “doubt or the observer of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave” (p. 97). The greater the
uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be
able to predict behaviors and consequences. During interaction, individuals are
not only faced with problems of
predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe
the way they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted, once
more when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of interpretations
that a stranger can believe of potentially weakly" Uncertainty plays a role in the
formation of relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit social ties when examining
certain areas of uncertainty which can lead to four types of communication outcomes remember.
