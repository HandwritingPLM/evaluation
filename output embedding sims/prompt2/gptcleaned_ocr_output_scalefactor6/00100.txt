Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1931. He earned his A., MA. and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, in 1968, he worked on some global planning communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and its application in various fields such as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2003 because he was suffering from kidney disease. He died on December 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1995), diffusion refers to the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation can be an idea or product perceived as new by an individual or group of individuals. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels. Rogers (1995) mentioned, "this S-M-C-R-E model corresponds closely to the elements of GAS" (p. 195). Specifically, (1) senders can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) messages can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally, (5) the effect can be individuals adopting or resisting change. In this diffusion theory, time is an important factor. According to Rogers (1992), the key factors in diffusion are (1) the adoption decision process, (2) innovativeness, and (3) an innovation's rate of acceptance. Much innovation follows an S-shaped curve of adoption. This curve can vary based on the rate of adoption of an idea or innovation, whether it is fast or slow.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to literature: (1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4) Late Majority (Skeptical), and (5) Laggards (Traditional)" (Rogers, 2003, pp. 163-185). Rogers defined this term as "the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adapting new ideas than other members of his social system" (Rogers, 1995, p. 400). Figure 1 shows the relationship between types of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Moreover, these categories follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. When it comes to the process of innovation diffusion, Rogers (1995) mentioned that there are five factors:

1. Knowledge + or - (selective exposure or awareness of news)
2. Attitudes + or - (people have positive or negative attitudes towards innovations)
3. Adoption (Decision to adopt the innovation)
4. Implementation (regular or standard practice)
5. Confirmation (comparing and evaluating)
