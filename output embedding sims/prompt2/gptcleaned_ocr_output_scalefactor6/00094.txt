I NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows,
They provide a framework for understanding the relationship between media and audiences:

1. ‘The audience is considered an active, i.e., an important part of the media use process and should be more closely concerned ... patterns of media use are shaped by more or less
definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience.

2. In the mass communication process much might be on linking needs and
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behaviours.

3. The main component for source of need satisfaction, The needs carved by
The communication conditions build a sequence of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption
constantly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- ie., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their after and media intake
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal format.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience opinions are explored on their own terms (pp. 15-17)

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also emphasized that, although previous research on
gratifications detected several pretexts: Gals affect people on the media, they did not address the
connections between the gratification (Katz et al., 1974). They set out a more elaborate
explanation on linking aspects: “[1) the social and The psychological origins of (2)
Needs which predate (2) expectations of (4) the mass field of other sources which lead to (2) dif-
ferential experiences (e.g., engaging in either activities), resulting in (6) feedback production and (7) other
CORE effects, perhaps more closely unshared area” (Italicized, p. 15). The studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the set and Quantifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and expanded. The current status of needs and
gratifications is all based on Rat's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in
the age of electronic information where people have more options for media use.

Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perception and needs of audience members. Above all, Katz (1972) recognized people are the Great Consumers:
usages for very different purposes, The same media content may gratify different heads for different
individuals. There are not only one way that people use media, Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Gurevitch, 1974).

By needs, social situations, and the individual's background, such as age, race, interests, and
education, affect people's media abilities and the ways they benefit from media use. Thus, audience members can derive and achieve their desires and gratifications for using the media. McQuail, Blankey, and Brown (2002) proposed a model of “media-person
selections” for clear or organized media gratifications.
