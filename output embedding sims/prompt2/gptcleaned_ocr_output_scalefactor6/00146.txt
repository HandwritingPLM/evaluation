Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an individual (radiation in media research. The original
concept of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media content. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media
and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1983). There exists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which meds they can use to meet their needs.
In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
meeting need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use certain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to
passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus on “what media do to people” and assume audiences are homogenous, Uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with “what people do with media” (Katz et al., 1974). It allows
audiences personal needs to use media and responds to their media, which is determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
that the media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Katz
et al., 1974). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a
wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different.

The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing their reasons for using
certain media to the disregard of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained
from the media, based on individual social and psychologically need inventories (Parker, 1999). As a broader perspective among communication researches, it provides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants seek
information or content selectively, communicate with the media and their audiences (Greene
otal, 1997). Audience members incorporate the content to meet their needs or
to satisfy their interests (Lowery & DeFleur, 1983).

4.2. Origin and History

It is well accepted that communication theories have challenged through various realms: especially psychology and sociology over the past 100 years, with influenced by parallel ideas as well as incorporating more unlike fields in these two disciplines. Researchers elicit a series of tougher
conceptions of underlying media.
