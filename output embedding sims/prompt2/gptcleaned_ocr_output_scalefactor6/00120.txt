L. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1. Other Propaganda Theorists
Lasswell Laswell (1902-1976)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking critical analyses of it.
In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was related to prayer.
Harold Laswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both qualitative and quantitative analysis of propaganda, understanding the concept of propaganda,
and discovering the effects of propaganda on the audience (Rogers, 44). Lassell is credited with creating
the most common communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, [SM]. Generally, content analyses can be
defined as " ... the covert garden of communication norms can be categorized to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 156). In a preface titled "Concept of Communication," Lasswell (086) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the independence of the reels used. By understanding the command of the message, Laurel (146) aids in
achieving the end goal of understanding the "chain of influence that leads from one entity to another and from content
to audience" (p. 74).
This method of correlating messages can be tied strongly to Lare (SA) each definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. EA). One can witness
clearly the way that Lasswell's definition of communication, and Larewell's work within the area during the
early. Lasswell has created a model that makes clear the mistake of limited
and also the propensity to accept it. However, it may be that this over exaggeration is affecting their concepts within
the democratic system, and it is being presented as being more burdensome. This bears an interesting way of writing
the prevention of the lack of precision that is experienced. The airsimilarity to Liggranci's theories.

Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were formulating public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was earning a title as propagandist, propagandist, and public opinion. Beyond the
