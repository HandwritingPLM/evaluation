Other Propaganda Theorists
L.A Hare Laswell (1902-1978)

As Lipperean was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was analyzing was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 1958).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the components of propaganda, and examining the effects of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1958). Lasswell is credited with creating "The mass communication procedure of command levels" (Rogers, 1958). Generally, content analysis can be defined as "the investigation of communication levels by categorizing responses into classifications in order to see certain values" (Rogers, 1958). In an article entitled "Communications as Craftsmanship," Lasswell (1958) explains that a content analyst should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a text, the directions in which the symbols point the audience, and the proximity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1958) achieves the goal of understanding the "sources of influence that result from concerted Gs Careem and from the quality and contents of an audience" (p. 74).

The core of content analysis outlined strongly by Lasswell (1952) early defined communication which would value, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effect." Content analysis has many uses that are part of the framework, and Lasswell carried out work within this area during his career and his contributions in creating public opinion within a 5

a democratic system, really being presented to decisions made by the QO. This is an echo of Lippmann's thesis.
