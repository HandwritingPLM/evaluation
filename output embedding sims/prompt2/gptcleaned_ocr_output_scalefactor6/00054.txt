Defining Uncertainty

Origining uncertainty

Research conducted under the tile of interpersonal cognitive dissonance, social influence, and small group processes. Theories of social psychology, space, and judgement, and reactance (Berger, 2005) grew, with the pioneering research by Festinger, Heider,

having a considerable role in influencing a large number of social interactions,

relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the latter part of the decade as Knapp, Motirabian, Alias, Taylor, Dock, Kelley. and Thibaut, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation as well as communications research

Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the direction tends to doc

on dynamic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction

understanding of interpersonal process.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
were a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1950) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of
Predicting present and past behavior, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way
that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
process when they stated “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things
that a stranger can believe or potentially say" Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining

relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can

cause stress and anxiety which can lead to lower levels of communicator competence (West &

2000). Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or may be too anxious

to engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty cause

increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking. In inter-

actions individuals are expected to increase predictability with the ability to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. When uncertainty exists in a relationship,
more ease of communication, a less anxious
can a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “Too.
