1. MEDIA AND GRATIFICATIONS

Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes that media is a tool used by individuals to fulfill certain purposes. Mueller and Hare (1974) concluded that different people seek to satisfy different purposes. The same media content may gratify one particular individual in various ways. There is not only one way that people seek media consumption, as it depends on various factors such as physical needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education. These factors shape people's ideas about what they want from media and what media can provide. In other words, audience members are aware of and can articulate their motivations for using different media. McCuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important reasons for media consumption: 1) Diversions (escape, relaxation, entertainment); 2) Personal relationships (companionship, social utility); 3) Personal identity (self-reference, reality exploration, value reinforcement); and 4) Surveillance (information seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience motivation was suggested by Moe (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and motivation stability of "growth" and "preservation." When combined, these factors yield 26 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A restructuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (Pierson, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1972) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and the Giberts infvised three core pes aie di
