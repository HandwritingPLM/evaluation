Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the public, and the perception of attention-generating propaganda is integral to public opinion (Bernays, 1928, p. 11). Hermays (SE) makes a statement regarding basic principles, the engineering of consent he said, Engineering public opinion. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old times: it is a noise publicity and propaganda (Bernays, 1928, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays' theories offer a different view of the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippman, who viewed the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass to be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 68). Indeed, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be on amicable and mutually beneficial terms. It must see itself, its aims, and perspectives, to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 111).

Bernays elaborates on this: Mass communication is Public Relations, here a business enters into the public through openness. Perhaps pointing a favorable relation into a solid used among the layers of the public. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to him (1945, p. 44). Bernays' view of the public is different than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes their power and influence, but still maintains that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to view and evaluate the perspective of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts being made by others, and to participate in significant courses of action (p. 77). Under this framework, while the public is still manipulated, it is not so much their ignorance that is a threat. The state much like Lippmann and Ellul a divide can be imagined.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

More specifically, the models developed by Cayman, Connell, Beil, and Bernays not only represent the ideas of their predecessors, but also bring new insights to the table. The public is able to be influenced by these theories that emphasize the importance of understanding and communicating with the public in effective ways. This research has shed light on the varied and rich history of public opinion research and the potential efforts that can be presented in this paper have the potential to disrupt the status quo in organizing public relations efforts. Overall, the research of the scholars presented in this paper has been important to the understanding of the conditions and the manipulation of public opinion. This paper shows a mix of viewpoints. While the theories of Lippmann and others help us understand and analyze the society that surrounds us.
