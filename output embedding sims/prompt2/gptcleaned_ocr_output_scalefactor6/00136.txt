Rogers is Cornell, received in 1931. He earned his BA, ML, and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard before serving in the U.S. Army Police and later planning communication projects in Korea. One of his works focused on diffusion theory and its applications in sociology, political science, and advertising.

Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2X due to kidney disease. He passed away on October 1, 20%.

According to Rogers (HA), diffusion refers to the process in which aspects are communicated through various channels within a social system. This may involve the adoption of a practice or project by an individual or group of adopters. The concept of innovation involves the spread and adoption of new ideas and technologies, as previously noted.

Rogers mentioned that communication channels play a vital role in disseminating information and influencing the adoption of innovations as useful. Later, a model of communication was presented with five parts, focusing on the sender, message, channel, receiver, and effect (SMCR model). Rogers stated that this model closely aligns with elements of diffusion. Specifically, opinion leaders can act as seeders, messages can contain innovative ideas, various channels can be utilized for communication, receivers can belong to a social system, and the effects can range from individual adoption to societal change.

In diffusion theory, time is a critical variable according to Rogers (1995), as it is involved in the innovation-decision process. Key factors influencing this process include innovativeness, the rate of innovation, and the adoption curve. Rogers emphasized the importance of understanding how different factors influence the stages of innovation uptake and ultimately impact communication behavior.

Rogers identified five types of adopters in the diffusion process: (1) Innovators, (2) Early Adopters, (3) Early Majority, (4) Late Majority, and (5) Laggards. These adopter categories are based on individuals' willingness to adopt new ideas relative to others.

Rogers described a standardized curve that represents how innovations spread through a population over time in an S-shaped manner. Different populations may have unique adoption curves based on their characteristics and inclinations towards innovation. The curve of diffusions represents the progression of innovations through distinct groups of adopters over time.

In the process of innovation decisions, Rogers noted the importance of knowledge, attitudes, adoption decisions, implementation, and confirmation. These factors play a crucial role in how individuals perceive and adopt innovations in various contexts.
