Therefore uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.

The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals within a group.

1 Early Influences

These founding theorists significantly contributed to the understanding of uncertainty in communication. The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1944 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics after Lewin's death. Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research. Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and in the development of WRT. Festinger is best known for the theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) explored how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual, as Lewin had observed changes in attitude in small groups. CDT allows for three relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in harmony with each other, a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other, and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions do not affect each other. Cognitive Dissonance theory focuses on the role of arousal and discomfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory posits that individuals look for feedback from others to evaluate themselves as they compare their performance and abilities. To validate the self, one usually seeks opinions of others who are similar to them in the area being judged. This theory of Social Comparison can result in conformity pressures. Berger and Calabrese (1975) related social comparison to Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT) by stating that "Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation" (p. 157). Festinger received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's legacy is significant, and his theoretical influences can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in Festinger, 1980) stated, "It was in this era that Leon Festinger conceived and developed his theory of cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since" (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1985)

Fritz Heider obtained his doctorate in psychology after leaving his career in law, studying in Europe. Heider worked with many psychologists and anthropologists such as Max Wertheimer and Char to.
Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as having a substantial impact on his work: "I want to pay tribute to Lewin's molding influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which I am still seeing alive in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work" (Heider, 1958, p. viii). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later at the University of Kansas, where he worked for the remainder of his life (Aronson, 1980).
