At a recent meeting I attended, the main topic of discussion was the upcoming summer break. There was a wide range of views on this issue. Some people argued that it was important for students to have a break from their studies, while others felt that the break was too long and could negatively impact their academic progress.

One concern raised was that students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds may struggle during the break, as they may not have access to the same resources as their more affluent peers. This could widen the gap between students from different social backgrounds and have a long-term impact on their academic achievement.

Overall, it was agreed that more support needs to be provided for students during the summer break, particularly for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This could include access to educational resources, support with mental health and wellbeing, and opportunities for enrichment activities. By providing this support, we can help ensure that all students have the best chance of success, regardless of their background.
