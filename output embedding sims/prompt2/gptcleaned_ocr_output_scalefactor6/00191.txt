NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevich as follows. They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media audiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, and an important part of mass media use is assumed to be goal-oriented. Patterns of media use are shaped by a set of definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience.

2. In the mass communication process, much initiative in linking need gratification and media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on theorizing about any form of cause-and-effect media content on attitudes and behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by mass communication constitute only a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves. People are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own merit.

Additionally, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevich also commented that although previous research detected diverse gratifications that attract people to the media, they did not address the connections between these gratifications. They suggested that uses and gratifications research should concern itself with the following aspects: "the social and psychological origins of needs, which generate expectations of the mass media or other sources that lead to differential exposure or engagement in other activities, resulting in need gratification and other consequences, perhaps most notably unintended ones." The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid the theoretical foundation for building the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and gratifications is still based on Katz's initial analyses, particularly as new media forms have emerged in such an electronic information age where people have more options for media use.

Needs and Gratifications

The uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same media for very different purposes. The same media content may satisfy different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users. Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background all play a role in shaping media use.
