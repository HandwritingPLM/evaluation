A language is therefore a collection and system of values. The encoding of the meaning of this is really a collective contract which one must abide in order to be understood by others. Essentially, a language is a kind of contractual agreement which is based on a social understanding. In certain languages, which are a combination of sounds that are arranged by conventions, spoken by individuals and understood by others, spans both a dictionary and a set of conventions. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with the intention of expressing personal thoughts using speech which is specific to themselves.

Interestingly, the act of communicating actively through language increases connections between individuals and therefore promotes social integration. Focusing on the social aspect, Semiotics uses the language of signs to give meanings to objects. The signifier and the signified in conjunction create signifiers and the way they interrelate. The form of Gold has many meanings, each of which contributes to the overall understanding. For example, both the word Gold in English or in Korean signifies the same material but in different languages. This distinction between signs is important in understanding the relationship between the signifiers and the signified, as well as their overall concept. The correspondence between the perceived sign and its meaning lays the foundation for the arbitrary and non-arbitrary nature of language, emphasizing the relationship between the signs that operate within the system of signifying units.

Signifiers are interrelated and form part of a larger whole which functions independently. The merging of signifiers is facilitated through a process of selection and combination of elements, resulting in the creation of new meanings within the framework of language. This process of selection and combination is organized into a signifying chain which identifies the connections between signs both on a conceptual and a physical level. The regulation of this system of signs is governed by the relationship between the signifier and the signified, ensuring consistency within the signifying process.

In conclusion, the understanding and interpretation of signs within the paradigmatic structure is influenced by various factors which affect the arrangement of signs within the system. The sociological aspect plays a crucial role in shaping the meaning of signs within the paradigmatic construct, constructing a complex interplay between the signs and their meanings.
