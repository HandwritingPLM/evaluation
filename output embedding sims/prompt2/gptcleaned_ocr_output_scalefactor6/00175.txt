Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach (an inflectional tradition of research) grew out of a classical research area. The original conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of certain media contents. The core question of mass research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1952) There exists a basic idea in this approach that people choose content, and which media they use to meet their needs.

The approach contrasts with earlier media theories that emphasize the passive audience as recipients of information. In contrast to traditional models that focus on "what media do to people" and assume audiences are passive, the uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). It explores the personal reasons for media use and how individuals respond to media, which are influenced by social and psychological backgrounds. Uses and gratifications approach also suggests that different media platforms and content play a role in satisfying different needs of audiences. Contrary to the public perspective of audiences as passive receivers, uses and gratifications approach highlights the active role of audiences in selecting their media for fulfilling their various needs.

The categories have evolved into various forms and have been applied in different disciplines, reflecting the dynamic nature of media research.
