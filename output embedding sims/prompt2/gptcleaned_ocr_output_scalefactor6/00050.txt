i. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic principles were stated in a study of Katz, et al, in 1974,

1. The audience is not passive,
being goal oriented.
Individuals have well-defined expectations of what
their uses of media.

media Choice lies with the audience consumer. This places a strong emphasis on
theory about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitude and

The Media Compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
Media come from the Corum Come Complex and a Streeeet of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption certainly varies.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goods of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- i.e. people
who are culturally self-aware to be able to repeat the niceties and narratives in
Particular cases, or at least to perceive them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

Value judgements about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience demands are explored on their own terms. (e. 1317).

In addition, Katz, Schomer, and Gurevitch have commented that, although past researches on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that affect people of the media, they did not address the
connections between these predictions (Katz et al, 1974). They suggested that uses and gratifications
research concern with following aspects: (1) the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) media gratification and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unexpected ones (Katz et al, 1974, p20) The studies of Boyer and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The careful slice of uses and
gratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in
such an electronic information age when people have more options of various uses.

1. Needs and Gratifications

The gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members:
One study concluded that different people can use the same communication and
different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for
different people. (cf. Pilices & Katz, 1974)
