1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach was perhaps (generally) oriented (toward) understanding. the nature of the relevance of realities to audience experiences.
Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication resources for very different purposes. The same media content may genuinely serve different needs for different individuals. This is not only true for the way that people use media. but also for the reasons for using the media. Contrary to the assumption that people use media for personal release from tensions or problems, it can be suggested that the media are used for a variety of reasons: personal relationships, such as friendships and social support; entertainment: escape from reality or problems; emotional release; companionship; social utility; personal identity; self-esteem; information: and surveillance; and social interaction (Blumler & Katz, 1974)

Another extended version of the audience's content needs was suggested by McGuire (1989). He proposed a general theory of human desire. He distinguished between the basic needs of cognition and affection. Then he added three dimensions: active versus passive involvement, internal versus external orientation, and intrinsic goal orientation, and further divided them into "growth" and "preservation" orientations. When charted, these factors yield 16 different kinds of motivation that apply to the media use (Figure 1). Structuring of the perceived environment as a function of their motivation (McGuire, 1989). Katz, Gurevich, and Haas (1975) developed 25 needs drawn from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and placed them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding

2. Affective needs, involving emotion, escape, feelings

3. Personal integration needs, such as credibility, stability, and consistency

4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with others, feeling connected and socializing

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion

Congruently, McQuail's (2004) classification identified the following common reasons for media use:

- finding out about current events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world

- seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision choices

- satisfying curiosity and general interest

- learning, self-education

- gaining a sense of security through knowledge building

- finding reinforcement for personal values

- finding models of behavior

- identifying with valued others in the media

By gaining in-depth knowledge, audiences can better meet their needs.
