Defining Uncertainty

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hoyland. By the 1950s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, personal development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Metrablan, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade and into the 1960s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson. Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the dynamics of relationships. It has been a personal communication.... Uncertainty reduction (Berger, Campbell, & Nelson, 1975).

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has become relevant in communication theory. To consider uncertainty through the theoretical framework of information theory, let’s discuss some of the major contributors to the development of LUT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) applied Shannon and Weaver’s information theory to interpersonal communication. Altman and Taylor (1973) introduced the concept of uncertainty to the interpersonal realm. From a theoretical perspective, Berger’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted that uncertainty stems from the unknown and unpredictable nature of human interactions; uncertainty can arise from a variety of sources.

In initial interactions, people may experience uncertainty about their relationships or may engage in increased verbal and nonverbal behaviors, signaling their uncertainty.
