i. RETURN TO GERMANY

1 Return to Germany

In 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested that their work was published without their permission, fearing it might jeopardize their return to Germany. As the fate
of the Institute remained uncertain, it relocated to Frankfurt, with new premises opened in 1801. Horkheimer
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 134 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rapid industrialization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of understand
of psychological control (Adorno, H, p. 134). He was one of the few academics in the 1 050s
who focused on the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of the day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jaeger, HEM, p. 101). Adorno would sometimes even attempt to reshape
his thoughts on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, L080, p. 20), and gave a public talk in Germany in 1961 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1956, while writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno argued that filmmaking might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the borders of academia (Heberlaht, 1956, p. 181).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse argues for an analysis of late capitalist society in a systematically critical, as opposed to
other writers at The Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1982, p. 65). Instead of addressing
cultural alienation, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society result in
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Feltz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it created a system of suppressive
efficiency that the best elements of society stifled and quiescent (Alewry, 1965, p. 53). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology where mass objectives were in

fundamental contradiction and the manipulation and understanding was maintained to control

During Adorno's time, Marcuse wondered whether the
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and instrumentalization (Marcuse, p. 8). Moreover, it is difficult to balance arguments separating spheres
Of The Geology from society as a whole because Marcuse does not distinguish culture as specific
markers and entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. The layered aspects of society allowed for multiple interpretations. Marcuse concluded that he was a philosopher, not an activist. Like polemics 'this work requires much revision, I received this work only on condition that the
Fischer publishing house would publish
it. The work goes beyond what had previously been done by adding an aesthetic and entertainment aspect.
