ELL OLHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1) Other Propaganda Theorists.

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

Harold Lasswell was a propaganda theorist. While Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 2005).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1976) was a prominent researcher in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both quantitative and qualitative analysis of propaganda, understanding the control of propaganda, and discovering the effects of propaganda on the target audience (Rogers, 2005). Lasswell was credited with creating “The Mass communication procedure of content analysis” (Rogers, 2005). Generally, content analysis can be defined as, "the investigation of communication messages by counting various message elements in an systematic manner in order to measure content variables" (Rogers, 2005). Lasswell termed “Centers of Communication,” Lasswell (1958) explains that content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience’s opinion, and the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1945) aims to achieve the goal of understanding the “area of influence the culture can exert in a concentrated area” (p. 71).

This method of content analysis ties strongly to Lasswell (1958) each definitional communication which says, “Who says what to whom in which channel to what effect” (p. 61). Content analysis was carried out by others with the tool Lasswell provided and he went onto work within this area for the remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda shapes public opinion. Lasswell primarily worked on understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democracy. Lasswell had created a conception, seeing the practice as a "lived-in information that is presented so it feels real, and also appears to be real. However, this simulation can affect their decisions within the democratic system, and is being presented dominantly by the government. This can be breeding confusion among views of the public that is contradictory to Lippmann's ideal.

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were crafting public images of propaganda, Maurice Berreys (1995) was examining the relationship between propaganda, public concern, and public opinion. Berreys (1995) was investigating the effects of informal shapes seen in social issues, data, or people. In another perspective, Berreys recognizes that the observer can either be led or have their individual values decide what to think subconsciously functioning as a bolt.

Barney (1955) writes, “We are predisposed, culturally and individually coherent, our beliefs are defined, largely because we have received, reassured, an example, we remember more lines of moral and social communities interacting. If they are not Aged together, this is a uniquely debilitating experience and suffering is a crucial effective path.” For only those ideas that the public opinion can be trusted, this clear path may be established Barney's proposed that there needs to be a reconceptualization of public psychology that may have been altered, or Lavine does (Berreys, 1995).
