It is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology over the past 100 years. Informed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more verified fields in these two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of media effects research, the uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally started from a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory on communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in this theory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential effect upon audiences by injecting information into the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill 1997, p. 106). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to the establishment of uses and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as empirical mass communication research itself (Mundall, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programs, such as soap operas and quiz shows, as well as daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1999; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry 1988; etc.). In these studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium itself (Matz et al, 2006). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice, support, or emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1944) rather than just offering information. Newspapers were also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Krech, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage satisfaction, sociologist Herzog (1946) marked them with the term “gratifications”.

The uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970 when television became popular. Some basic summaries of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz became one of the most well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz was weaned both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1963. During the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about broadcasting and television in history, culture, and communication from the 1970s to 1996. In 1993, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania and also directed its post-doctoral Scholar program.

Katz's main research comrade at the Hebrew University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who was one of the pioneers of gratifications research. Their cooperating work produced important categories that connect the concepts of gratifications with the functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced the uses and gratifications approach when he came up with the notion that people use the media to their benefits. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haeri (1973), a subject which has become a theory, uses and gratifications research were conducted. They cited the research media as to whether individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to their needs more readily than the media overpowering them (Herzog, Gurevitch, and Haeri, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Rott published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which were entitled "The Uses of Mass Communication". They took a more human approach to looking at media. They argued that media can cater to a real source that best fulfills the needs of the user, and they have a choice to satisfy this need (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission for both society and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
