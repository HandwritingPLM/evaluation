Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

The Uses and gratifications approach is an influential perspective that focuses on the conception of how people use media and certain media contents. The core question of SUGT PRSES is what do people use them for? (McQuail, 1982). This approach suggests that people's needs influence what media they choose, how they consume media, and what gratifications the media provide. This approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to passive recipients of information. In contrast to traditional media theories that focus on "what media do to people" and assume audiences are homogeneous, the Uses and Gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1973). This perspective emphasizes audiences' individual needs, social and psychological backgrounds, and how they interact with media content. It also suggests that media competes with other information sources to satisfy audience needs (Reitz et al., 1974). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide a wide range of platforms and content, the Uses and Gratifications approach is considered one of the most appropriate perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to engage with different media. This approach focuses on audiences' choices, reasons for using certain media, and the gratifications obtained from the media based on individual requirements. In a broader perspective, this approach provides a framework for understanding how media participants seek information, select content, and engage with media based on their needs and interests (Katz et al., 1974). Audience members incorporate media content to fulfill their needs and satisfy their interests (Lowery & Nardulli, 1983).

1.2 Origin and History

It is well recognized that communication theories have evolved through the realms of psychology and sociology, exploring more unified fields in these two disciplines. Researchers have developed a series of higher conceptions for understanding media.
