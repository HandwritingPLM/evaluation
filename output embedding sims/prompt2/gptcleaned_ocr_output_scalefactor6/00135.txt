DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct necessary for the study of communication, it would be beneficial to learn how the concept originated, and how it has been defined in theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty is present in a given situation when there are a high amount of possible alternatives and the likelihood of their occurrence is not easily determined. Shannon and Weaver related the view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of IRT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from information theories, as well as Hovland (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the "number of alternative ways in which each interaction might behave" (p. 601). The greater the breadth of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behavior and occurrence. During interactions individuals are not only faced with perceptions of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially want". Uncertainty plays a significant role in examining relational development. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can lead to incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or sustain same Teenagers in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty lead to increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking, thus increasing the odds that this will lead to better ability to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty exists, it is difficult to reach this goal. Although individuals may feel less secure and risk being rejected, high levels of uncertainty can also inhibit a relationship. Heath and Erford also view of certainty and predictability can weaken a relationship; they state, "Too much certainty
