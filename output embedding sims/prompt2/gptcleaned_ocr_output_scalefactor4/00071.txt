the public, and must study what terms the partnership can be
appealing and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims,
and the public intentions which the public can understand and is willing to accept.
Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1942). Rather than merely attempting
to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man can help his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or help the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p. 6). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1962) writes of the
benefits of public relations, "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade and suggest courses of action" (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is most in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tend to disagree with his point.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Laswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann and others have brought attention to the fact that
the public is able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more
recent research that is meant to help understand the influence of the media on the public. Many researchers, such as Bandura and Kinder, McQuail, Combs and Shaw, to name a few,
â€˜have contributions to the study of
the media. The public has also become more aware of the role of gatekeeping, agenda-setting, and priming and the potential effects that these functions have on their audiences.
