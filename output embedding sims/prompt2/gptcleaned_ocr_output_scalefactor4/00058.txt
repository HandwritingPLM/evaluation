The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture ca film and radio did not seek to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, all the while using the ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and, AL A). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist

industry, but modernism. Although he perceives the idea as opposing force in the culture industry,
Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis behind, his focus in seeing that the dominant system
utilized capacities for mass consumption for profit or amuse. .
