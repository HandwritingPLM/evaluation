ere published without their permission in 1940, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late 1960s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1969. Horkheimer became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1964 Adorno published an essay entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done by the Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerber and others. In this essay Adorno warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed of psychological control (Adorno, 1964, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1960s that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments of the 1960s (Jaeger, 2004, p. 190). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture in the United States (Adorno, 1994, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1968 on The Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film, Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Horkheimer, 1969, p. 131).

Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of false affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 53). In this ideology, where media and entertainment spectacles had become organized around an ideology that maintained that commercial interests were to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that commercial interests were to perpetuate the ideology that maintained, that entertainment spectacles had no function other than that of reinforcing the commercial structure (Marcuse, 1963, p. 67).

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and media can be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions in difficult times. Marcuses argument to emphasize that culture could be distinguished from the brutality of dominant ideology, in the way that previous analysts of society allowed for no opposition to the dominance of dominant ideology. ipation humans had done, in the end it were, Marcuse, examining society, showd that the individuals had made their own material happiness, their own satisfactions, and these reproduce on an enlarged scale both their lives as well as those of other masters! How is it that anyone would yet think that Marcuse, 1968, p. 241) given the pessimistic tone of the times, because of the television programming in the US and Germany that boasts an insidiously complacent message.
