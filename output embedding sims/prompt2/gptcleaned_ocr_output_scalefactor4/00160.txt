EARLY INFLUENCES

Therefore uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.
The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce
uncertainty.

1 Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but later followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of EVT. Berger is best known for his Cognitive Dissonance theory
which explores how inconsistencies between beliefs and actions might affect an individual's relationships
Cognitive uncertainty, has an element of uncertainty in which individuals seek to predict an outcome and
usually seek the opinion of others who are similar to the self. This need for similarity may
result in conformity pressures (Tremblay & Fenson, 2011). Berger also extended social comparison theory by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons tend to seek out those
who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty concerning
their behavior and/or opinions

His theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary research.
Festinger, 2001) stated, “It was a theory of cognitive dissonance, and in my
opinion, that is my greatest contribution".

regarding the self.

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in psychology in Europe. Heider worked with many peers on
collaborative research projects. Heider, like Festinger, recognized the importance of group dynamics and sought to pay tribute to Lewin's stimulating influence, which was still strong even in this book, although it does not dominate the text. In 1942, Heider moved to the United States, specifically to
Kansas, where he worked for the remainder of his career.
During his time in the U.S., Heider conducted groundbreaking research that stemmed
from his work” (Heider, 1975).
