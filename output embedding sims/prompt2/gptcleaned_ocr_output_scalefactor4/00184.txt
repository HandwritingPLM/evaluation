Uses and Gratifications

4.1. Introduction

The uses and gratifications approach is an alternative view in media theory. The original conception of the approach focuses on audience members and their needs.

The uses and gratifications approach puts the focus on the audience, linking their needs and gratifications on the side of audience members. It considers how they seek information, in contrast to the traditional view which assumes a passive audience.

This approach sees people as active participants in the media, making choices about the most appropriate media for their needs. The approach emphasizes audience choice by assessing their reasons for using a certain media to the disregard of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin & Tankard, 1997). From a broader perspective among communication researchers, it provides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants seek information or content selectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Katz et al, 1974a). Audience members then incorporate the content to fulfill their needs or to satisfy their interests (Lowery & Nabi, 1990).
