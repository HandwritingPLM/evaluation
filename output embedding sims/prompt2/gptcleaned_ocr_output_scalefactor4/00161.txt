Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1951. He earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, he was involved in communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and some theory in such fields as geography, psychology, political science, and communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 and passed away from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1955), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation shall is a practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels.

Communicational channels such as interpersonal communication or mass communication, people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Laswell (1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts: (e.g. sender-message-channel-receiver). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “there`s a more communication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion.” Specifically, (1) sender can be innovators or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally, (5) the effects can be individual's adoption of social change. In the diffusion theory, “time” variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1965), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1) the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; and (3) observability. Rogers (1965) also mentioned that innovations have an S-shaped scale of adoption. Different perspectives are important for understanding how and why user and audience seek information, such as the influence of media, word-of-mouth, interpersonal influences being important areas of influence. The individual's weight, the value of analysis also, critical factors play an important factor to be considered when more people perceive things in a certain way, they tend to adapt.

There are five different types of adopters in the innovation process: (1) Innovators, (2) Early Adopters, (3) Early Majority, (4) Late Majority, and (5) Laggards (traditional). Rogers stated that innovators are more vital in adapting to new ideas than other adopters. Rogers highlighted the relationships between people and how they make decisions.

When a theory can apply to peace efficiency. There are several different perspectives on the diffusion process. Rogers (1962) defined the five stages of adopting an innovation and how the different types of adopters behave in the process.

Overall, it is important to understand the diffusion process and how different factors can influence it. Rogers' work has had a significant impact on the field of communication.
