In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of mental health. It is now widely accepted that mental well-being is just as important as physical health, and that the two are closely linked. Mental health problems can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life, affecting their relationships, work, and overall happiness. Therefore, it is essential that we prioritize mental health and ensure that adequate support and resources are available to those who need it.
