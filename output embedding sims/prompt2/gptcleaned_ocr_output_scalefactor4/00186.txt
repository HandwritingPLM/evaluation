1 Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination. The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the subsequent theories.

1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the field of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed his theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential, among them cognitive dissonance, a consonant relationship in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other, and social comparison theory, which suggests that individuals seek feedback from others to evaluate their performance and usually seek to compare themselves to others who are similar to themselves. This results in conformity pressures (Trenolte & Jensen, 2004). Heider and social comparison theory by stating that "Festinger has suggested that people can survive as long as they have high life meaning by appropriate social comparison."

His theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary communication. Festinger (2000) stated, "It was in that era that Leon Festinger, cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, some social psychology became the game changer."

1.2) Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from a university in Europe. Heider worked with many influential individuals such as Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial influence and wanted to pay tribute to Lewin's stimulating influence. As seen in his book, although it does not directly derive from his work.

In 1926 Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).
