CRENESTS CHE "THE CULTURE INDUSTRY"

Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to understand the premise of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception, the essay explores the conditions through its genealogy. It argues that the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, a perspective developed through LaRPALE.

It is mentioned by prominent authors such as Hollywood producer-collector, and multi-annually generated oppositional work. The growth of the culture industry is also a result of historical contingencies.

A significant turning point was the year 1923, when theorists such as Benjamin and Adorno engaged in heated debates. Benjamin earned a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, while Adorno, according to Hanns Eisler, introduced a revised version of his ideas into academic philosophy. The relationship with Benjamin had a major impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Referring to Frankfurt and teaching at the university, Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party. However, Frankfurt had already established a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, where Benjamin was also operating. The Nazi rise to power not only resulted in Adorno's departure from Germany but also affected his philosophical thought. As JÃ¼rgen Habermas would later note, the fact that many intellectuals were co-opted in the development of dictatorial regimes was one of the key experiences influencing the development of critical theory.

Adorno relocated to the United States in 1938, where he worked on a manuscript found later. This manuscript would serve as a precursor to his later works on mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture. The essay "On the Fetish Character of Music and the Regression in Listening" serves as a response to Benjamin's more optimistic view in "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." Adorno specifically highlighted the problem of mechanical reproduction and the loss of the aura of the original artwork.

The Pomfret school's general attitude, Adorno's included, was one emphasizing the importance of authenticity in cultural production. However, Adorno became dismayed by the level of commercialization in culture in the United States. Adorno also briefly mentioned Walter Benjamin, who had died before receiving a degree that would enable him to teach at a university, ultimately leaving Adorno as his only pupil. After Benjamin's death, it was Adorno who sought to formalize and develop Benjamin's ideas in academic philosophy. This relationship with Benjamin had a lasting impact on Adorno's thought. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno resumed teaching at the university. Adorno was also introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1921, but their relationship became strained, leading Adorno to further develop his philosophical ideas independently.

Overall, Adorno's time in the United States and his interactions with other scholars helped shape his views on the commercialization of culture and the challenges this posed to artistic authenticity.
