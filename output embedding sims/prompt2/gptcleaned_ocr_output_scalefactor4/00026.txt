Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original
conception of the approach was based on research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media content. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media
and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1983). There exists a basic idea in this approach
that audience members choose media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.
In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use certain media, and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to
passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories, which focus
on “what media do to people” and assume audiences are homogeneous, uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with ‘what people do with media’ (Katz, 1959). It allows
audiences personal needs to use media and respond to the media, which is determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
that the media compete with other information sources for audience need satisfaction (Katz
et al., 1974a). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people a
wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the appropriate
ways for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different perspectives by assessing their reasons for using

The approach emphasizes the gratifications obtained
from a media to the disregard of others, as well as the various grati

er social and psychological requirements (Severin &

For communication research, it provides
a broader perspective for understanding the processes by which media users appropriate content selectively, commensurate with their needs and interests.
Audience members then incorporate the content to fulfill their needs or satisfy their interests (Lowery & Nabiia, 1983).
