7. CRITICAL RESPONSE TO THE CULTURE INDUSTRY

He complained to the dean about the radical students in his classes who were menacing
teaching: “in the winter term of 1862-60 students occupied a number of buildings
at the University of Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research. After the sit-in
ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, including
one “tasteless demonstration” in which three females bared their breasts. Adorno died a few
months later (Müller, 2004, p. 21-08).

A Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German-speaking context. In the years since there have been some
criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 84). For the
generally sympathetic Debora Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural
production, and failed to underscore the culture industry’s economic dependencies on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).
For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overstated the dominant ideology, believing that
“capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton, 1981, p. 45).
Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed proletariats in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 26). Frederic Jameson pointed out that Adorno’s idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, analogizing the society that developed in the 1930s
and 1940s with new media when compared to the cultural possibilities available during the 1910s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be extended as a useful theory for analyzing social
issues between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohenchahl,
1985, p. 85408). Thus, for some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.
For some critics, modernist works would be counteracting forms against the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to the
hence, society. Since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culture
industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has
been generally ready for some to challenge the idea of a culture industry. It is nonetheless the
case that movies are still made by large companies and that films largely rely
on formulaic plots. It should be noted that radio is increasingly controlled by fewer
companies, which tend to favor rich genres; music stations operate. As a broadcast
medium, television is very much related to both radio and film, and shares with
cultural industry. While there is democratization
[in that anyone can create a web page and have an audience,
The literal interpretation of the idea of the culture industry may be necessary
how mass communication media propagate dominant discourses which are lasted.
