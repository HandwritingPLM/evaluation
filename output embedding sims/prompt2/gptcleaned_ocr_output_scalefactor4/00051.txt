itself (Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
ate ahh or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944: Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, a newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topic

of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term "gratifications."

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Soc
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University
of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication from the 1970s to 1990s (UPE Al, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one of the pioneers of gratifications research.

Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
induced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
