Hello to all aspiring scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. Saussure's mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the parole. While Saussure is peerless to the latter parole, Langue is the systematized set before the common, indifferent to the material of the signal which is spoken language (parole) is covers the purely individual part of it (Barthes, 1987, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, the me, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized, as said a bal because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is flexible due to the fact that a speech by an individual cannot be free from the language.

A language is therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not to a pure creation (Barthes, 1957, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word "dog" in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "I propose to retain the word sign (signe) to designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifi√©) and signifier (signifiant), the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis revised ed., p. 59). The correspondence of the concept is not in the destined meaning but rather, in the arbitrary relation. This is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference Saussure (1960) argues that "language does not reflect pre-existent and external reality but constructs meaning from within itself through series of conceptual and phonic differences. According to Saussure, meaning arises out of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic signifying system" (Barker, 2008). The syntagmatic order, the syntagmatic between the signs, sentence, and the paradigmatic signs or another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the babysitters, "This sentence like: "My sister and girlfriend went to a the same theater, my mother, so such as I had to go to a different venue such as a restaurant with her mother." The example illustrates that the synthesis is incorporated only when anything to entities in context by the syntagmatic combination can be replaced between signs" (Barker, 2008). In relation to the difference and into a sequence which generates a particular context.
