i. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AND MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything seen in Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with which Europe could not compete. The closest thing in Europe was the new advertising techniques. (Jaeger Adorno was later known for his experiments with the Radio Research Project in the culture industry that sought to understand the manipulation of consumers, and at 18 he saw this research as indistinguishable from propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). They both disagreed on the value of empirical studies until Adorno proved that the purpose of the Project was to enhance American sociology.)
