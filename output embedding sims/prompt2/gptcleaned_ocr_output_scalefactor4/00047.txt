Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the complex of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT), accredited to Charles A. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1979), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryan (2000) state: “One of the main functions underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p.15). The study of information is present in all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
references in the field of interpersonal

communication, which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Calabrese note: “When communication. plays the role of ommunication into the central
opment of the field of interpersonal communication, Berger and Calabrese researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as a starting point” (p. 99).
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of interpersonal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began to focus on creating a framework for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

The study of communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field. Interpersonal communication is
often linked to studies into language, social cognition, and social psychology. Prior to the 1950s, a
modest amount of research was completed under the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant
(2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly when researchers
defined communication as the central variable because they wanted to study (Baron states as cited
in Heath and Bryant)” (p.1). The 1950s impacted the development
of the field. Research in psychology examined personalities and the influence of relationships
related to a variety of personal and social problems, but also raised the importance of self-esteem and how it
could be improved
through affective change. This inspired the idea that relationships
could be strengthened through effective problem-solving and understanding in relationships.

The field of interpersonal communication has been advanced through the development of URT, finding that
relationships and understanding problems as well. This has led to significant advancements in communication.
