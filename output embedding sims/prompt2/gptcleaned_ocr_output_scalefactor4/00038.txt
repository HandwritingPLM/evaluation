thing in Adorno's experience to the advertising industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his apprehension about the culture industry by noting the systematic blurring of the line between cultural products and political division and stating that he saw this research as being industrial rather than political (ibid., p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not see eye to eye on the satisfaction with propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with

propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97) led to his departure from the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the Freudian motivates him to further develop the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually lead to the idea of the culture industry.

The idea of the culture industry and its development can be understood through the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University. Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until November 1941. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that including Frits Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred DÃ¶blin, and Bertolt Brecht, several of whom found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood movies must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditions - Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the relationship of several of them to the Hollywood film industry - are all important to an understanding of his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 16). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Horkheimer, 1995, p. 142). Examples of this specified by Adorno were the Hollywood production system, or the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplanted the work (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 84). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system, and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual (Friedman, 1981, p. 16). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of coercive persuasion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 26).

Since Adorno had been a significant defender of high art, the Culture Industry has been criticized as being a radio, an apparent. defender of high art, The Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the null PO Popular culture (Adorno, 2002, p. 101).
