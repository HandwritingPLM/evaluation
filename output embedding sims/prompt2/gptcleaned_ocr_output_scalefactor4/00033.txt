Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications

Blumler and Katz argue that perceived needs and satisfactions are very different for different people consuming the same communication media. There is not only one way to satisfy many different needs for different people.

Using the Uses and Gratifications Theory, they argue that media needs are met through audience members selecting from a variety of media options, based on their own motives and desired interactions. There are four main gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from everyday life; (2) Personal relationships: forming and maintaining relationships; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; (4) Surveillance: keeping informed.

Another subdivision of the audience's needs was proposed by McGuire, inspired by a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. He added three dimensions: "cultural" versus "functional" orientation, "visual" versus "aural" channel orientation, and "internal" versus "external" goal orientation. When plotted on a chart, these factors yield different types of motivations which can apply to media use.

McGuire et al. developed 35 needs from the social psychological functions of media into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, and fantasy;
3. Personal integrative needs, including self-esteem, identity, etc.;
4. Social integrative needs, including relationships with family and friends, etc.;
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Similarly, McGuire's classification of the following common purposes for media use are:

- Finding out about relevant events and occurrences in immediate environment, society, and the world;
- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinions and decisions;
- Satisfying curiosity and general interest;
- Learning and self-education;
- Gaining a sense of security through knowledge.
