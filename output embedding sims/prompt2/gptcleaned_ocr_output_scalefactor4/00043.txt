Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and discomfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social

result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen,

2004). Berger and Calabrese (1975) related social comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others

who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and opinions in a particular situation” (p. 1074). Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger’s
theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research.

Festinger, 1980) stated, "It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and refined
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since" (p. 1).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of
Europe, Heider worked with many renowned psychologists such as Wilhelm Wundt and
his time in
uni Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial influence for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000). Later he moved to the University of.
