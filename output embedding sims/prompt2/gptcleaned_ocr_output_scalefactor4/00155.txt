Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics.
Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which composes
it; as opposed to it, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1967
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level,
langue, is the social convention or value shared through society by which it is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression of the individual level. However,
it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be torn from the
shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
just an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing their personal thoughts. It is because speech is
essentially a communicative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not just a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

A sign consists of two parts: the signified and the signifier, which are expressed through the
form. The signifier is the external part of language such as a spoken word in English or Morse code. The signified is the internal part of language, representing the actual thing or concept in question, for example. I propose to divide the sign in order to show that meaning can be created through the relationship between the signifier (sound-image) and the signified (concept). The two parts have the advantage of indicating the meaning only in relation to each other and to the whole of which they are parts. The correspondence of the signified is the relationship, as argued by Saussure, Tanguay asserts that language â€”
is a process of signification relating to the power of selection within the paradigmatic axis.
