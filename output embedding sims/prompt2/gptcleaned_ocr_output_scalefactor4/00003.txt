Early Influences

The following significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication in the 1970s. Berger and Calabrese (1975) completed their doctoral work at the University of Michigan under the direction of Kurt Lewin, Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research on group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the study of uncertainty in interpersonal communication. Berger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to join the Research Center for Group Dynamics.

After graduation, Berger initially followed his mentor's footsteps at MIT, where his work was highly influential (Turner, 2000). Berger noted that individuals are able to manage uncertainty by seeking information from others. Aside from the direct influences he received from Lewin and social psychology, Berger acknowledged additional indirect influences he received while at the Research Center for Group Dynamics.
