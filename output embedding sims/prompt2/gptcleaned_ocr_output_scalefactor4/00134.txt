Other Propaganda Theorists

1) Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann writes in "Public Opinion" Harold Lasswell's work was significant, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was ac.

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda
and discovering the effects of it.
This research generated considerable analysis (Rogers, 1954). Generally, content can be
classified as, “the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
to consider variables” (Rogers, 1954) for an essay entitled "Elements of Communication."
Lasswell (1946) explains that content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience’s opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from creator to content and from content
to audience” (p. 74).
This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell's (1952) early definition of communication which
stated, “Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effect” (p. 3). Content analysis was essentially the say what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.
Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell created a credo, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still the information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann's theories.

Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
fictamely being, written by Lippmann himself.

2) Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public in an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theories, Bernays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial in society's functioning as a whole.
Bernays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never heard of... Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live
together as a smoothly functioning society” (p. 3).

Based on these ideas that public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is a necessary aspect of
society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of public relations. “Public relations is essentially a management
function, anil it aims to engineer public support for an activity, cause, movement, or institution” (Bernays,
1955, p. 23). In the Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) lays out the framework for understanding the public
and developing a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relations
campaign is to tailor the message to the attitudes of various groups in society, gather information
effectively express an idea, and finally, utilizing persuasion to influence the public opinion in the intended.
