I. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the social influence and interpersonal communication theories play a significant role in influencing interpersonal processes. The pioneers of social psychology in the 1970s, such as Festinger, Kelley, and Heider, have greatly contributed to shaping research into behavior and interpersonal communication theory. Berger (2005) notes that theoretical forays by scholars such as Taylor, Duck, and Kelley have helped shape research agendas and the field of communication as a whole. Interpersonal communication theory focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships, with uncertainty reduction being a crucial aspect of interpersonal processes.

Since uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study contributing to the development of communication as a whole, this chapter aims to explore the significance of uncertainty reduction in communication. Berger and Calabrese (1975) note that uncertainty has been pivotal in driving research into interpersonal communication theory and processes, leading to advancements in the field of communication.

Defining Uncertainty

Uncertainty, as identified by Shannon and Weaver (1949) in information theory, exists in situations with a high number of possible alternatives and relatively equal probabilities of their occurrence. Berger and Calabrese (1975) extended this concept to interpersonal communication, defining uncertainty as the number of alternative ways in which individuals may behave. High levels of uncertainty can hinder relational development, causing stress and anxiety that may lead to communication difficulties. Incompetent communicators may struggle to develop relationships or engage in interactions due to uncertainty.

While individuals seek to reduce uncertainty to increase predictability in relationships, excessive certainty and predictability can also have a negative impact, potentially dulling a relationship, according to Heath and Bryant (2000). It is challenging to accurately predict future interactions in situations with high uncertainty, and striking a balance between certainty and uncertainty is essential for maintaining healthy relationships.
