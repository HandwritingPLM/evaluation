Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics.
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels: the synchronic system and the diachronic system of speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of elements necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signals which compose it, as opposed to speech, which covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 1987, p. 13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, langue, is the social convention of valid shared through society which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language; essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thoughts. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not to pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure categorizes the language system into two parts, signified and signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through its form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word dog in English or in Korean are the material form expressing the actual animal, the concept in question, becoming the signified. To remain the word sign/ signifier. Evoke broadly separate them from concept and sound-image respectively. The signifier and signified have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are part of (Barthes, 1967, p. 37). The correspondence of these concept and sign are not historical or natural relation, but rather, an arbitrary relation. It is this arbitrary relation, according to Saussure (1960), argues that language has a separate use in, constructing meanings from affect a present and external reality of independent objects. Through a series of conceptual and phonic differences, a complex and more potentials for the three kinds of signs: indexical (e.g., symptom), symbolic (e.g., door opener), and iconic (e.g., picture) under a process of selection and possibility of the semantic and the syntagmatic to the paradigmatic (e.g., synonym). The syntagmatic means a grammatical set of signs or the underlying grammatical system in use and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can replace a sentence. The paradigmatic contrasts with the syntagmatic, the selection is not isolated particular; the possible combinations between syntagmatic and the paradigm outcome condition part of language. This sentence is a string of signs. The sentence within the grammatical, syntagmatic, and the paradigmatic. Saussure presents every sign in its nature as conceptually interrelated. Subsequently, Saussure prioritizes everything equally exists relative to each other. "Crucially, signs do not take meaning by referring to an external object but rather, they generate meaning by their interrelation with other signs" (Barker, 2002, p. 2). It's central to Saussure's relational view of meaning which generates between signifier and signified. These signs are from us through their cultural conventions of their usage within a particular language.
