ars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural theory. 

To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two main parts. The former is called langue and the latter parole. 

While the former is necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signal plane, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 1957, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. Langue is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized. Parole, on the other hand, is flexible because it is the actual expression of the individual and is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from shared convention, the structure.

Like many other structuralists, Saussure sees language as a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract which one must accept entirely to communicate. Language is a system of contractual values that resists modifications from a single individual and is a social institution. In contrast, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization where the speaking subject can use the language code to express personal thought. Speech corresponds to an individual act, unlike language which combines both institution and system (Barthes, 1957, pp. 14-15).

Saussure distinguishes language systems into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through a form, while the signifier is the external part of language. The correspondence between concept/meaning and the external form is in an arbitrary relation, not an inevitable internal relation. Meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes, organized into a signifying system (Barker, 2002, p. 29).

The selection of signs within the same paradigmatic is regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. Language constructs meaning through relationships between signs, understanding as a social convention organized through the relations between signs. Meanings are generated through cultural conventions within a particular period, reflecting differences between signs such as red, green, amber, etc.

Therefore, language is seen as a social convention organized through the relationships between signs (Barker, C.).
