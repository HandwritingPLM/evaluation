Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1924, and the two theorists became friends. Benjamin received a depression that would allow him to teach at a university in effect, Hermann's only pupil. After Benjamin's death, a rationalized version of his ideas was introduced into academic philosophy. The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Moving to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the university. Adorno's visit to Spain in September 1979 gave rise to the spread of the Nazi party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Switzerland, and Adorno was there. The Nazi rise to power meant that Adorno would lose his job and eventually leave Germany, which also affected his philosophical thought. Adorno knew that the German laborers were co-opted in the development of a single party. Thus, influencing the development of critical theory, which ultimately leads to the production of mass culture in the United States.

Benjamin became estranged from Adorno. Adorno stayed in London from 1938 to 1958, where he worked with T.W. Adorno was considered an outsider, never integrating into British academic circles. As propaganda and entertainment began to dominate popular culture in the 1970s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, as art forms became increasingly commercialized with the rise of fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. Adorno believed that music and literature could combat propaganda and dominate fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" was a primary concern for Adorno due to his belief that art could be captured in a mechanical reproduction and reproduced on phonograph records. Schiff notes that the destruction of art by technology is incompatible with music and the new listening habits that result in a shift from adult to infantile music. While Benjamin saw the destruction of art as incompatible with technology, Adorno viewed the challenge of mechanical reproduction as an opportunity for culture to resist capitalism.

In conclusion, Adorno forwarded working alliances with British academics and emphasized the importance of art in fighting fascism. Adorno's work became controversial in the United States after World War II, and his views on art and culture influenced a new generation of scholars. Adorno's work eventually led to a prestigious research position at Columbia University and a partnership with the social research project. He contributed greatly to the culture industry in the United States.
