Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

He complained to the dean about the critical and radical students in his classes.

It had become impossible. In the winter term of 1968-69 students led a protest at the University at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research. After peace ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, including one "tasteless demonstration" in which three females bared their breasts. Adorno died a few months later (Jaeger, 2004, p. 201-08).

Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since, there have been numerous critics of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about “the commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production and failed to examine the cultural industry's economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48). For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, believing that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton, 198, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the system as a whole” (Eagleton, 1951, p. 3). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno's idea of a culture industry was historically limited since the society that developed in the 1960s and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s. While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial societies between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 46-45). Thus, for some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would appear to be merely historical if they, in fact, concede that it had any value at all.

Thus, for some critics, modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture industry has had an importance critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, and it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and hence, society. Since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culture industry and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. It is more the case that motion pictures are still made by large companies and that their movies largely rely on formulaic plots. It is also the case that media is increasingly controlled by a small number of companies, which tend to impose their own narratives. As a broadcast medium, television is very much related to both radio and film and shares with them the situation of being in the culture industry. While there is a democratizing aspect to the Internet in that anyone can create a website, it happens that the commercial companies operating on the Internet continue to maintain an ideological function. For example, one might not see stories on MSN or Yahoo that would question the prerogatives of real armies. A reexamination of the idea of the culture industry may be necessary in order to understand how mass communication can propagate dominant ideologies.
