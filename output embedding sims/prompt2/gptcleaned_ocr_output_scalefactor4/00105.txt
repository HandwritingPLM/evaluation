Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the Public Relations (PR) public policy and public opinion, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing society (Lippmann, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1935) himself made a statement regarding his theory, the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time harangue or early pufferism-and propaganda (Bernays, 1935, p.1). Furthermore, Bernays theories represent a different perspective on the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated, The public is not an amorphous mass that can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 60). Instead, Bernays suggests that if attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be made amenable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the audience which the public understands and is willing to accept.

Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations in a contemporary situation, that helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952). Bernays also recognizes the power of persuasion as he limits manipulation of the public. It is important because it helps them to understand the interactive use of leadership in a way that persuades and encourages rather than manipulates the public: is still potent contrary to the views of Lippmann and Ellul. 

Ellul defined and Bernays and Ellul are important for a number of reasons. Lippmann is important as well, as he brings attention to the fact that people can be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues Boor [Professor] is essential to understand the influence of the media on the public. The theory that they present helps to give a more comprehensive understanding.

The theories developed by Lippmann based on the ideas of these researchers have been researched in recent years by researchers including Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs. Research has been done on the functions of the media such as gatekeeping, agenda-setting, and the limited effects of the media while influencing only thought, but not necessarily behavior. It was noted that research in this area has been limited but has provided a starting point.

In examining the theory developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul, it offers insight into the society we live in today. The utilization of these theories helps us understand the society we live in and how propaganda could be influencing the masses through the media.
