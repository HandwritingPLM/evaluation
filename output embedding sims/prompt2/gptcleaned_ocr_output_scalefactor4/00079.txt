Research conducted under the title "Defining Uncertainty" examines small group processes. Theories include uncertainty, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2013), a forefather of social psychology. A considerable role was played by Quine, Kelly, and Howland. By the 1980s, research focused on the role of uncertainty in interpersonal development, and it was supported by empirical evidence. Their work in this area has been influential in the field of social psychology.
