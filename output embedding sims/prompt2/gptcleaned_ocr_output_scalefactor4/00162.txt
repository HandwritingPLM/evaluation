1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Since interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
He was grouped processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, facial judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2006). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology
Played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research. Pioneers such as Fevinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of scholars such as Reeves, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade
and into the 1950s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Blanlp, Realalt, and Berger became popular
along with research in behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Augeon, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) states: "these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research
agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, and communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research in interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been perceived that
interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a separate field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communications as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
on those theories that delved into the importance of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and it is essential in our
understanding of interpersonal processes.

1. Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, especially in the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been assessed
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
were a high number of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this type of uncertainty in the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of WAT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded on ideas from the
information theorists as well as Heider's (1950) research on attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty in interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the "number of alternative ways in which an interactant might behave" (p. 430). The higher
the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences. Engaging in interactions, individuals are not only faced with problems
predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way
that they do. Berger and Bradacâ€™s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of the
process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternatives that a
sit would can believe of potentially occupy." Uncertainty plays a significant role in creating bonds of closeness in relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relationship development.
Researchers point to the importance of reducing uncertainty which can alleviate fears of communicator incompetence. Turner and Roney (2006) suggest that individuals may not be able to develop relationships effectively or may be uncomfortable in social interactions. Hall and Taylor (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty lead to clearer verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking. In intimate relationships, it is expected that a decrease in uncertainty will lead to predictability with the hope that this will lead to the ability
to anticipate future interactions. When high uncertainty exists it is often perceived as negative, Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty can lead to the ability to predict a relationship. Hoth and Bryan (2000) wrote: "Too much certainty
and predictability can deaden a relationship.
