were published without their permission in 1940. Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing
themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the 1940s, the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1964, Adorno published an essay
that was the result of a study that had been done for the benefit of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
transformed modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed

of psychological experience (ibid., p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s
that Adorno would delve into the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it

strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments

(Marcuse, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape

industry. For example, in 1999 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture

(ibid.), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1961 titled â€œThe

Mind, when writing the essay Transparency in Film,

Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to

the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1965, p. 151).

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wonders whether the alienation aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their functional functions
(Marcuse, 1964, p. 256). However, it is difficult to argue separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end, Marcuse's analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology. Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individual be to make their assimilation
into their own Werth and satisfactions and thus reproduce it on an enlightened scale" liberate
themselves from themselves as well as from their mores. How is it conceivable that the
vicious cycle be broken? (Ibid., p. 280). Given the pessimistic tone of the essay,
it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as a for Leftist
movements of the 1960s in the US and Germany that developed an opposition
In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others
associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated
into practice (Chambers, 1989, p. 320).

In reviewing the text in 1961, Friedrich Pollock reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that the
work required too much revision to pass dissemination. The two authors continued to
negotiate with the Fischer publishing house until 1963, and may have only agreed to republish
the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals.
