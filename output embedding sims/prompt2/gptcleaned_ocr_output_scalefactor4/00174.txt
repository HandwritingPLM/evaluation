Uncertainty Reduction

Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uncertainty
Reduction Theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations
underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Calabrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” (p. 6). The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of interpersonal communication research; with the development of
URT, communication researchers began to look to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather
than theoretical approaches founded in other social
sciences.

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field, since
most often linked to studies into language, social cognition
modest amount of research was com

(2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly since 1960,
scholars adopted communication as the central term because they wanted to study it as a
pier of human behavior” (p. 59). The 1960s marked a significant development of an interpersonal field, Research in Psychiatry examined personality and the influences of relationships at
a psychiatric context. Where it was not only a result of self-problems, but a social base. Such research trends in humanistic psychology and existentialism
gme effective at helping relationships and
fed the idea that they could be improved.
