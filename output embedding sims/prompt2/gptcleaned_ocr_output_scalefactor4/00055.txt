Linguistic mechanism by speaking actors. The former is called by Saussure Structural linguistics. On two levels, the Systematic system and the Variation Langue and the latter parole. Langue is necessary to communicate with according to it.

Indifferent to the material of the signal which comes; speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language” (Barthes, 2007, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure’s linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, langue, is the social convention or value shared through society which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level.

It is considered relatively flexible due to however, the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention. The structure of language is therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of the contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to resist the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not a pure creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two; the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "I propose to retain the word sign So as to designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified cele us signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1958, in R ral (ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the concept meaning to the fore arene spelling relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation relation, but rather, it is an arbitrary relation. It does not exist between the signs that operate the signifying system. Saussure perceives the sign as signs that do not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but as a reason a sort of conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Saussure, Meaning and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic and paradigmatic, organized into a signifying system” (Barker, is produced through a process of selection. The syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and a paradigmatic field of possible signs that can be related to one another. Despite various possibilities In selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, the linguistic community agrees upon the consensus of linguistic conventions. For an example of the syntagmatic, one could consider the sentence: “I went to a restaurant with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the linear combination of signs in their particular context. The signs in the sentence are related only when other signs in the paradigmatic are substituted for by other. “Crucially, signs do not make a clear reference to each other. Thus, meaning is understood as a convention organized through the relations between signs” (Barker, C., a002, p. 29). “It's clear that meaning is generated through the relations between signs, amber, between red, or a particular context.
