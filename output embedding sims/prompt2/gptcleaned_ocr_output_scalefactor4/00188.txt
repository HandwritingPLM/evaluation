It is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology over the past 100 years. With formed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untried fields in these

disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding, media as a subdivision of media effects research, was a graticfocations approach initially believed to be originally stemmed from a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumer & Katz, 1978). To be more coherent, functional theory on communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the theory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential

effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses” (Walton & Mills, 1975, p. 105). Functional theory influenced that the 1980s. After that, a high

and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is also at odds, as empirical mass communication research tells (McQuail, 2004). Dating back to the 1980s, researchers began to be interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as Soap operas and quizzes, as well as daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1989; Katz & Liebes, 2007). In their studies, researchers discovered a list of themes generated by some specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1974). For instance, radio soap operas were found to supply the listener with advice,

puppet, or occasions for emotional release (Gerbner et al., 1974); rather than just offering information, newspapers were also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics

of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1955). For these diverse dimensions of usage satisfaction, psychologist McQuail (2004) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s with the rise of television as well. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among the group of scholars who took off on uses and gratifications explorations, Elihu Katz is a giant of the field and made great strides to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is revered as both a sociologist and a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1962. During the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work on broadcast and television leisure, culture, and communication from the 1970s to 1980s. In 1980, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its

supplemental Scholar program for post-doctoral students.

Also a member of Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld who was one of the pioneers of gratifications research. Their collaborative work produced important developments that connect the concept of gratifications with the functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratifications approach when he came up with the notion that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1972), a subject which later became essential in gratifications research was explored. They reviewed the manner

by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to

their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which

were entitled The Uses of Mass Communications. They took a more humanistic approach by looking at what

were. They suggest that media were dark cuts, a medium forces that best fulfill the needs of the user and

they have alternate choices to satisfy their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media

served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission for both society

and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
