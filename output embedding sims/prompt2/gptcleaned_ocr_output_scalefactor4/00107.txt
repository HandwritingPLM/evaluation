THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of cultures in the United States has always been a very privileged and pervasive. Furthermore, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something worth noting in Europe. The changes in the United States was something worth noting in Europe. The changes in the United States were so widespread and deep-rooted in the advertising industry in the United States that focused propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 1944, p. 1). Adorno goes into details about his experience with the Princeton Radio Research Project in his essay on the culture industry, also stating that his research had implications far beyond political propaganda. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project could eventually lead him to further develop the idea of the culture industry.

Members of the delegation who attended the Institute for Social Research at Columbia University, Horkheimer, also left California to bring Adorno to the West Coast with Max Horkheimer. When Adorno was finally able to return, he worked with an impressive array of Hollywood figures, including Prt: Lang, Arak Sobwnkerg, Hoos Steer, Charles and Memnot Haan, Alfred Dethia, and Bertolt Brecht, all of whom found work in the Hollywood entertainment industry. The fact that Adorno's contacts with members of the production industry facilitated his where about and that Adorno's work with members of the Hollywood entertainment industry also lent itself to a deeper understanding of his ideas of the value of the industry.

The text in question delves into Adorno's exploration of mass culture and art and how they interact to perpetuate societal norms. For him, popular culture enforces the status quo, while high art provides a critique on the same. Adorno's critique of popular culture is based on its mechanisms of mass production and standardization, which limit the possibilities of true artistic expression (Horkheimer and Adorno, 1944, p. 105). In this sense, the culture industry serves as a form of social control that hinders true freedom of expression.

Adorno specifically distinguishes avant-garde art as a form of resistance against the homogenizing force of the culture industry, championing individuality and creativity. He acknowledges the complexities of the culture industry's influence on society, highlighting the tension between commercial appeal and artistic integrity (Adorno, 1991, p. 50).

The text also mentions Adorno's stance on the relationship between high art and popular culture, emphasizing his defense of high art against the perceived degradation caused by the culture industry. Adorno views avant-garde art as a counterforce to the commodification and standardization of culture by the industry (Adorno, 1991, p. 50).
