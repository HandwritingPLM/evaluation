1. RETURN TO GERMANY

1 Return to Germany

When published with their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing
themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late
50s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises on 10. Horkheimer
became the Vice Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of work that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institutionalized forms modern mass culture into a mode of widespread
psychological control (Adorno, 1991, pp. 34-35). Up were some of the few occasions in the 1930s
that Adorno would address the implications of mass culture At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the sixties (Jaeger, SMM, p. 80). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1956 he wrote for a university periodical
in the United States (Adorno, 1991, p. 21), and gave a video talk in Germany in 1967 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay 'Transparencies on Film',
Adorno conceded that filmmaking might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modern [Hohendahl, 1995, p. 11].

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
1 Wiggershaus, LH, 61. Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marxist social critique mechanisms it advanced unrestrictive poetry and
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Beitr, 2000, p. 13). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
effluence that kept elements of society subdued and quiescent (Marcuse, 1983, pp. 32). The
entirety of society had become an assortment of technology whose main objectives were to
maintain social control and could be perpetrated in a way that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from its manipulative and indoctrinating functions
(Marcuse, 1983, p. 81). However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture or
society from the whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or technology as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuse's analysis of society still revealed no opposition to the dominant
political logic. Marcuse wrote, "Where can the polesrestored, whereby individuals become
again bounders of their own liberties and enjoyments, and thus reproduce on an enlarged scale
liberate themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? There is even a thin
likelihood that the vicious circle be broken?" (Marcuse, 1983, p. 250). Given the pessimistic tone of the book,
it is somewhat ironic that largely none of it would be perceived as an impetus for leftist
movements of the time in the US. and Germany that developed an oppositional stance.
In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others
associated with the Frankfurt school, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated
into practice (Chambers, 2004, p. 18).
In reviewing, the best in 1967, Fred Pollock reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that the
work required to receive permission to re-publish. The two authors permeated, began to negotiate with the Fischer publishing house but SH, and may have only agreed to republish
the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals.
