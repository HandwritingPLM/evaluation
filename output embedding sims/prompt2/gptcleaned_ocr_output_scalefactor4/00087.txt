Well-educated academic theories have developed through the lens of psychology. Combining over 200 years of valuable research exploring more varied fields in these disciplines, researchers have reached higher levels of understanding. A non-traditional tradition of media effects research, uses and gratifications approach, is suggested to have originated from a functional paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory on communication agrees with certain effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the study, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that the mass media have a direct, immediate, and influential effect upon audiences by "injecting" information into the minds of the public (Watson & Hill, 2007). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1970s. After that, a shift that acknowledged the relationship between media and people occurred and led to the establishment of uses and gratifications approach. The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media began as early as in the 1920s. Coming back to the 1940s, researchers became interested in the reasoning for using different media genres such as soap operas and quiz shows, and newspaper features. In these studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1974). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy the need for emotional connection, PR, or escape. For psychological reasons, engagement was also discovered to provide a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and a sense of community. For these diverse dimensions of engagement, psychologist Herzog (1974) associated them with the term "gratification." Needs and gratifications approach became prevalent in the late 1950s. This approach was first proposed when it was reconsidered during the early days of the group of scholars who focused on uses and gratifications research. Elihu Katz emerged both as a sociologist and a communication researcher. He obtained his PhD. in sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1960. During the past thirty years, he led the Departments of Sociology at the Hebrew University’s Undergraduate, Graduate, and Doctoral programs, funded by the Government of Israel for leading the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting. The experience led to a unique academic work abroad legitimizing and elevating leisure, culture, and communications from the 1960s to the 1990s. In 1982, he left the University of Pennsylvania School at the University of Penargylendorsity and directed its experimental School: Program for Sociological Theory. Many media scholars rewrite in Paul Lazardo, who was one of the pioneers of gratifications research. That seminal work produced important findings that connected the concept of gratifications with the functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced ideas and gratification approach partnership when he came up with BA, 1974, on a subject which is portrayed highly at the nexus of the uses and gratifications research. They viewed these needs or expectations as a methodical way to induce individuals to share mindsets with others and claimed that people base their needs largely on whether the media power feeds or satisfies them (Katz, 1974). Along with colleagues Jay G. Blumler, Curt, published a collection of Lectures on Gratifications in 1994 which were credited “The Uses of Mass Communication”. They took a more theoretical approach to looking at feedback. They suggested that media users are selectively exposed to media stimuli that fulfill the needs of the public. They also discussed more an ongoing pattern such as Social Role Theory, Moderating variables, and individual preferences.
