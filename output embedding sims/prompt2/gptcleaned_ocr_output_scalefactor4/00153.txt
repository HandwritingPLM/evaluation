In 1931, he earned his B.A. degrees from Iowa.
In 1966, he worked on some family planning programs in Asia.
The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and its applications of geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously mentioned, in Mexico in 2004.

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation is an idea, practice, or object perceived as new by a mass media and in.

A model of communication that is analyzed as five parts: S-M-C-R-E (sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E communication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally (5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, 'Time' variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1999), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1) the innovation-decision process, (2) innovativeness, and (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most innovations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such as the Internet. According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the past the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the more people get benefits. In this sense, diffusion theory not only can apply to practical things, but also can be related to the digital divide.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (deliberate), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional). “Innovativeness refers to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas in the system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure 1 shows the relationships between types of adopters and the adoption curve. Also, these categories are divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve, which is bell-shaped.

1. Knowledge + or - (selective exposure of awareness of news)
2. Persuasion + or — (trying to change attitudes)
3. Decision (people decide to adopt the innovation)
4. Implementation (regular or standard practice)
5. Confirmation (comparing and evaluating)
