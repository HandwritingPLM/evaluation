Through the realms of psychology and sociology, I developed a well-accepted communication theory that is exploring more untilled fields in these understanding media. As a sub-tradition of two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher concepts that initially stemmed from a functional media effects research, the uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be within a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). The communication theory agrees with media's effects towards people. The Hypodermic Syringe model discusses that "the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses" (Blumler & Katz, 1974). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses and gratifications approach.

The gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well as daily newspapers (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.). In these studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1974). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice, support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering information, newspapers were also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

The uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television had grown up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication from the 1970s to 1990s (UPENN, 2001). In 1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania and also directed its experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor at Columbia University was Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one of the pioneers of gratifications research. Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced the uses and gratification approach when he came up with the notion that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), a subject known as the uses and gratifications research was explored. They viewed mass media as a means by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to their benefit rather than letting it overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas, 1973).

Blumler and Katz published a collection of essays. They suggested that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs they have and offer alternate choices to satisfy their needs (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission for both society and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
