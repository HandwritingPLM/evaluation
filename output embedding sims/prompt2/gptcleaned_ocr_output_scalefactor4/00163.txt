Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry, it must be examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, as well as its subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition to Hollywood movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno became in effect Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin's death, Adorno worked on a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy. The development of Adorno's thought during this period was influenced by the rise to power of the Nazi party. However, Adorno lost his right to teach at the Institute in September 1933 due to the Nazi party's influence. The Nazis' rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his departure from Germany, but it also affected his philosophical thought. As Jurgen Habermas would later note, the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical experiences influencing the development of critical theory, along with Stalinist repression and the production of mass culture in the United States.

Adorno worked at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked as an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream. He looked forward to joining his Frankfurt School colleagues, many of whom had moved to the United States. Already in the late 1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means to disseminate propaganda under fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. Adorno condemned the mechanical reproduction of culture, particularly music, as it diminished the authenticity and aura of the original work. Adorno's stance contrasted with Benjamin's view that such reproduction could challenge hierarchical tastes tied to class.

In 1938, Max Horkheimer, who had established a relationship for the Institute of Social Research with Columbia University, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project. Adorno saw the impact of culture becoming commercialized in the United States, leading to a critical viewpoint on mass culture. Adorno questioned the authenticity and value of culture being disseminated to the masses through radio and other mass media.
