1 Early Influences
The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty:
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had
substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, he initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the theory of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed Cognitive
Dissonance in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). Cognitive Dissonance allows for three relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship,
in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of discomfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory posits that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to themselves. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholen & Jensen, 2007). Berger and Calabrese (1975) related social comparison to Uncertainty by stating that “Festinger has suggested that people seek out similar others
who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger’s legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in
Festinger, 2000) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has never been the same since” (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Vienna. After working with many renowned psychologists such as Poffenberger and Kurt Lewin, Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial influence in psychology to Lewin's stimulating influence, which has affected much of Heider's strong work, even in this book, although it does not derive directly from Lewin's theory.

Throughout his life, Heider acknowledged Lewin’s
impact on his life: “I want to express to Professor Kurt Lewin the gratitude for what I learned in this
way of thinking and which is the cornerstone of so much of my thinking and which is also derived from
his work” (Heider, 1958, p. vii). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).
