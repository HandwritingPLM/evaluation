Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in affecting
public opinion (Bernays, 1935, p. 1). Bernays (1952) himself made a statement regarding his purpose,
the art of content. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time bait and mass popularity and
propaganda (Henares, 1958, p. 9). Furthermore, Bernays' theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1938) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 65).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, and helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p. 8). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, propaganda is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, and to evaluate the viewpoints of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 1). Within this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of
reasons. Based on the idea of limited effects, they were able to bring attention to the fact that
the public can be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more
recent research that aims to help understand the impact of the media on the public. Through the
work of Jamieson and Alder, Wahl, Gewirtz, and McCormick and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding
of the potential effects of media functions such as agenda setting, framing, and priming, and the potential effects that these techniques can have on
their audience.
The theories presented in this paper have tested both the direct effects and long-term effects
media models. Theorists such as Ellul believed in a model whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought processes, this is in contrast to Lippmann
who noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Iyengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in
this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the generalization of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul
were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
