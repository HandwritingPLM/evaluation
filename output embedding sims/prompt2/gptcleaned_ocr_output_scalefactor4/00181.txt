The Culture Industry" by Theodore Adorno and Max Horkheimer aims to understand the influence of the culture industry on society. Horkheimer and Adorno, along with Walter Benjamin and other members of the Institute for Social Research in Germany, sought to analyze and critique the impact of mass media on society. Benjamin, who had expertise in art and film, obtained a position in Britain to further their research. Adorno and Horkheimer, in collaboration with other Institute members, established a "radio project" as part of their ongoing work.
