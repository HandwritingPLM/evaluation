Rogers was born in Cedar County, Iowa in 1931. He taught at Iowa State University during the early years of his career. He earned his B.S and M.S. degrees from Iowa State College and his Ph.D. in communication from the University of Iowa in 1957. He then joined the faculty at Michigan State University, teaching courses in diffusion of innovations, communication theory and research methods, suffering from kidney disease, Rogers retired in 1987. He died on October 21, 2008 in Mexico. Rogers was married to Edith nee Saunders, whom he met on a blind date and, they married in 1953. They had six children.

Rogers developed the theory of diffusion of innovations, a theory that seeks to explain how, why, and at what rate new ideas spread through cultures. An innovation is any idea perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. An innovation can be an object, a technique, a behaviour, a process, a program, or an idea.

Rogers (1995) outlined five parts of the diffusion process: (1) the innovation-decision process, (2) innovation characteristics, (3) the communication channel, (4) the social system, and finally, (5) time period. Rogers proposed that innovations have an S-shaped adoption curve that follows a standard distribution pattern. The adoption curve is divided into different types of adopters. These are: (1) Innovators, (2) Early Adopters, (3) Early Majority, (4) Late Majority, and (5) Laggards. Rogers defined these categories based on the degree of innovativeness among individual members of a social system.

Furthermore, Rogers mentioned that there are five stages to the innovation-decision process: (1) Knowledge, (2) Persuasion, (3) Decision, (4) Implementation, and finally, (5) Confirmation. These stages represent the process by which an individual or unit within a social system adopts an innovation. Each stage involves different factors and influences that affect the rate of adoption. As innovations spread through various channels, different types of adopters play different roles in the adoption process.
