Theodor Adorno - The Culture Industry and Mass Culture

In his critique of popular culture, Adorno argues that popular culture on film and radio does not present itself as art, but rather as a business. This business, according to Adorno, becomes an ideology that legitimizes the production of what he calls "trash" (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 45). This business is based on what Adorno refers to as Fordist capitalism, where mass production techniques are used in the cultural sphere, leading to centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 142). Adorno gives examples of this, such as the Hollywood production system and the formulaic nature of movies and hit songs. Mechanical reproduction ensures that no real change occurs, and any innovation only serves to reinforce the system rather than challenge it (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, pp. 106-107).

Adorno points to Orson Welles as an example of an artist who was able to break free from these constraints and challenge the culture industry. By creating his own path, Welles stood as an opposition to the system, rendering it ineffective in controlling artistic expression (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120). Adorno argues that the culture industry suppresses true artistic freedom and creativity, leading to a homogenization of culture that inhibits the development of high art.

The central argument of Adorno's critique of the culture industry is that it commodifies art and restricts true artistic expression. Adorno believed that avant-garde art represents an alternative to the culture industry, providing a different vision of art and creativity. Adorno's work on the culture industry remains influential in understanding the impact of mass culture on society.
