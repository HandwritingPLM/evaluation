f ASSESSMENT OF GRATIFICATIONS:

1. Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience
members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication
message for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different
individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications
for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media person x
interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (aims of informa-
tion seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus
"internal goal orientation, and emotion stability of "growth" and "preservation." With that,
his analysis led to 16 different types of motivations when applied to media use (Figure 1).

Structure of 16 general packages of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas
(1973) developed 55 needs based on the social and psychological functions of the mind. Media and
put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings
3. Personal integration needs, building credibility, stability, and self-image
4. Social interaction needs, interacting with family and friends
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Concurrently, McQuail (1969) offers a model of the following core functions for media use:

1. Finding out about his/her environment and condition in immediate, nearby, and less-
    nearby worlds
2. Seeking others' help or opinion on and decision-making
3. Gaining guidance by good journalistic interest
4. Attaining self-education
5. Achieving a sense of security through knowledge.
