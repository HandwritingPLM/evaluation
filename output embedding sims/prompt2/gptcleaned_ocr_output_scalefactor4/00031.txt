NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

The need for gratification is rooted in the individual’s internal desires and feelings. It integrates innate needs with external gratifications. According to McQuail’s (1983) classification, the following are some common reasons for media use:

- Seeking information about relevant areas
- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinions
- Evoking curiosity and general interest
- Engaging in self-education
- Seeking security through familiar sources
- Finding reinforcement for personal values
- Finding models of behavior
- Identifying with valued others
- Gaining insights into oneself
- Finding credibility, social identity, and support
- Escaping from routine or seeking social utility
- Personal growth through exposure to different sources of information
