He earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and its applications in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation is an idea, practice, or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels" (p. 40).

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation is an idea, practice, or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels" (p. 40).

That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass communication, people can get information on an innovation and perceive its usefulness. Lasswell (1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed in five parts, S-M-C-R-E (sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, "this S-M-C-R-E communication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion" (p. 19).

Specifically, the sender can be inventors or opinion leaders, the message can be a new idea or product, the channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, the receivers can be members of a social system, and finally, the effects can be individual adoption or social change. In diffusion theory, the "Time" variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), the time variable is involved in diffusion in the innovation-decision process, innovativeness, and an innovation's rate of adoption. Most innovations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables that influence how and why users and audiences adopt a new information medium, such as the internet.

According to the evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the past the individual was usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to gain efficiency. The more people use them, the more people benefit. In this sense, diffusion theory can not only be applied to practical things but also can be related to the digital divide.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness: (1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (deliberate), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional) (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined this term as "the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other members of his social system" (Rogers, 1995, p. 40).

Figure 1 shows the relationships between types of adopters divided by Innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. These categories follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped.

However, as noted above, different types of innovations (e.g., the rate of tetracycline adoption is faster than that of hybrid seed corn) can have their own different rates of diffusion. Figure 2.

1. Knowledge + or - (selective exposure or awareness of news)
2. Attitudes + or - (people have positive or negative attitudes toward innovations)
3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation
4. Implementation (regular or standard practice)
5. Confirmation (comparing and evaluating)
