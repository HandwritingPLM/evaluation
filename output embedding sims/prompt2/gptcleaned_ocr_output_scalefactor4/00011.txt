CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public and public opinion is a key element of Bernays' theories on propaganda in influencing society (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays himself highlighted the importance of engineering consent, moving away from old-fashioned publicity methods towards a more strategic approach (p.22). His theories present a contrasting viewpoint to Lippmann, who considered the public as easily swayed (Bernays, 1928, p.60). 

In Bernays' view, public relations should focus on building partnerships with the public by explaining aims and objectives clearly (p.66). Rather than manipulating the public, Bernays saw public relations as a tool to combine public ideas with persuader objectives (Bernays, 1952, p.9). While he acknowledged the potential for manipulation, Bernays also emphasized the importance of public relations in helping citizens understand society and influence action (p.10). 

Overall, theorists like Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays have contributed significant insights into public opinion and media influence. Their work has paved the way for understanding how the media shapes public discourse and political agendas. By exploring different models of media effects, these theorists have shed light on the complex relationship between media, public opinion, and society. Their theories continue to have relevance in today's media landscape and are essential for understanding the dynamics of communication in society.
