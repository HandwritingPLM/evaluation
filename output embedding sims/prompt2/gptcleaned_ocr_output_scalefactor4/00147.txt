CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing
public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and
propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, "The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than

It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the

merely attempting to combine the use of the public and the purpose, public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,

1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts being made by others
and to persuade or suggest courses of action" (p. 10). Under this framework while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion.

Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a few reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that the public is able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues laid the groundwork for the study of the media and its effects on the public.

Through recent research that is meant to better understand the influence of the media on public opinion, scholars like Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lasswell, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of how various media functioned, the role of the media has been developed. This has led to a better understanding of how the media can influence public opinion.

The theories presented in this paper deal primarily with the direct effects of media influence. The limited effects model, as proposed by Lazarsfeld and Shaw, provides valuable insights into how propaganda could directly influence the thoughts of individuals. However, it also suggests that the media may also be influencing what issues are being prioritized for future research.

Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public, and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul may differ in their views on the role of the media and the public, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us and the formation of public opinion were formed years ago are still relevant today.
