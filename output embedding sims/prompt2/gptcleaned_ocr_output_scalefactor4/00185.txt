4. CRITICAL RESPONSE TO â€˜THE CULTURE INDUSTRY'

He complained to the dean about the radical students in his classes who in the winter term of 1968-69 students occupied a voice bundle iversity at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research. And then the term ended. Adorno returned to teaching, but all his lectures continued to be disrupted, including one tasteless demonstration in which three females bared their breasts a few months later (Jaeger, 2004, p. 201-08).

4 Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the culture industry outside of a German context. In the earlier portions of the text, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production and focused too exclusively on examining the culture industry as a whole rather than focusing on specific business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 2006).

In the years since there have been strides made in understanding the culture industry's dependence on other fields and the dominant role it distinguishes in the era of an all-pervasive reification (Eagleton, 1991). Eagleton stated that "the critical values and celebration among oppressed peoples in society has some part of them as well" (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Frederic Jameson also stated that Adorno's idea of a culture industry was heuristically limited and argues for its broad overlap with new media and communication technology. The distinction between culture and art in the present day weakens (Jameson, 1991, p. 146).

For Terry Eagleton, both using traditional "Gramsci's theory" (Eagleton, 1991, p. 451) and playing a role in the reproduction of social structures outside of the realm of an ethos of social possibilities are crucial. Thus, for a time, Tang Xiaobin explained. Once the exclusive domain of artists alone, the power of the culture industry has since helped shape political consciousness, questioning societal norms and values through cultural mediums and reproducing history (Cook, 2006).

Soames Covert discusses the intersection between personal experience and the culture industry and how it can co-opt one's desires for profit. His examples show how the culture industry can engage different socio-political groups and adapt to their tastes and preferences, even distorting historical narratives. In essence, the culture industry has been reshaped and molded by society's needs, creating a symbiotic relationship between consumer and producer.
