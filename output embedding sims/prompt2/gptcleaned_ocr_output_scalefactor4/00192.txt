The influence of their work can be seen reflected in assumptions of communication.

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied the substantial influence of social psychology and was a pioneer in the field. Festinger, on the development of the theory of group dynamics, had a strong relationship with Kurt Lewin, 

a education, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the Research Center for Group Dynamics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After Lewin's death, Festinger's research continued at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). His research following his mentor's passing focused on the integration of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison Theory. Festinger is best known for the creation of Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT), which attempted to explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to 

observations regarding how cognitive discomfort affects an individual. Lewin foreshadowed Festinger's work, grounding 

Festinger's legacy is significant, and his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in Festinger, 1980) stated, "It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since" (p. 3).

1.2. Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz. During his time in Europe, Heider worked with many renowned psychologists such as Walfrang Koller, Max Wertheimer, and Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial influence on his life; "I want to pay tribute to Lewin's stimulating influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which is derived directly from his work" (Heider, 1958, p. xiii). In 1930, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of Kansas, where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2004).
