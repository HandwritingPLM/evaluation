NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasize motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Conversely, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine of

problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (fans of information seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience’s motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on a general Theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiator, nearness versus
“distant” goal orientation, and emotional stability of “growth” versus "prevention". These factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 7 illustrates
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974).)

pia73ai developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mind
and put them into three categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including seeking information, knowledge, and understanding.
2. Affective needs, including emotions,
integrates personal, including pleasure, feelings,
reliability, capacity, etc.

3. Personal integration needs, including interacting with family and friends.
