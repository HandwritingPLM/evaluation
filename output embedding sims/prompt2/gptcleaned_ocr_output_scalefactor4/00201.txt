THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in Europe had far eclipsed anything seen in the United States. The closest comparison in America was fascist propaganda (Horkheimer & Adorno, 2002, p. 122). Adorno later referenced his involvement with the Princeton Radio Research Project in his essay on the culture industry, highlighting the statistical emphasis present in the research (Adorno, 2002, p. 97). Adorno eventually left the project due to his dissatisfaction with the empirical studies conducted by Lazarsfeld. This dissatisfaction would later inspire Adorno to delve deeper into the concept of the culture industry.

The connection between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University, along with Adorno's relocation to California in 1941, allowed him to join an expatriate community that included notable figures like Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, and Bertolt Brecht. Many members of this community were involved in the Hollywood film industry, influencing Adorno's perspectives on culture. This influence was significant given the constraints on creative freedom imposed by the Hollywood system, particularly for expatriates who had previously enjoyed artistic liberty in Weimar Germany.

Adorno's interest in music, his collaboration with Benjamin, his involvement in the Princeton Radio Project, and his interactions with the expatriate community in California were vital in shaping his critique of the culture industry.

In his analysis, Adorno highlighted how the culture industry did not prioritize art but instead produced mass-produced commodities intended to perpetuate consumerism. Adorno referred to this phenomenon as "Fordist," drawing parallels to the production methods of Henry Ford. This mass production led to standardized, formulaic content in industries like Hollywood and radio, ultimately stifling creativity and autonomy. Adorno pointed out instances where exceptions like Orson Welles managed to defy these norms, showcasing the restrictive nature of the culture industry.

The culture industry, according to Adorno, served as a tool of capitalist ideology, perpetuating mass consumption and upholding centralized control. Adorno critiqued this business model as antithetical to true artistry and posited that it served as a mechanism for social control. In contrast to the avant-garde movements that sought to challenge mainstream culture, the culture industry facilitated the dominance of lowbrow, formulaic content over genuine artistic expression.

Adorno's critique of the culture industry offered a Marxist perspective on the commodification of art and the suppression of creative autonomy. He underscored the industry's role in perpetuating consumerism and centralized control, presenting a stark contrast to the ideals of high art and artistic integrity.
