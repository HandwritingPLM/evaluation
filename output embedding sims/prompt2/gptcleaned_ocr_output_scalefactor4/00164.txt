Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's theories of language. Saussure defines language as a system of communication, indifferent to the material of the signs it conveys. He distinguishes between langue, which covers the purely conventional part of language, and parole, which is the flexible individual expression at the actual level.

Langue represents the linguistic system within the social dimension. It is a convention or value shared through society that is stabilized and standardized. In contrast, parole is flexible as it is the actual expression at the individual level, although it is still considered relatively flexible within shared conventions. Speech, as an individual act of selection and actualization, cannot be free from the social institution and system of values that language represents.

Saussure further divides the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is the concept or meaning, while the form expressing it is the signifier. This relationship is arbitrary rather than destined, with meaning constructed through conceptual and phonic differences within the language itself. Saussure argues that language constructs meaning from within, through syntagmatic (e.g., a sentence) and paradigmatic (e.g., a field of possible terms) axes.

The systematic organization of signs into sequences generates meaning within cultural conventions. Signs do not derive their meaning from an independent objective reality but through the relations between signifiers within a signifying system. Meaning is then organized into sequences that maintain cultural conventions within specific content.
