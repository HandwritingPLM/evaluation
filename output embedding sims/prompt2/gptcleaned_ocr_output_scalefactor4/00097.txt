To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism considers structural linguistics; it operates on two levels: by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematic level, the systematic system within the social dimension. The structure level, or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. Parole is the actual expression at the individual level. However, the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the system within the social dimension. The structure level, or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. Parole is the actual expression at the individual level. However, the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the system within the social dimension.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual agreements the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can of the language with a view of expressing his personal thought essentially a combative act.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the la signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. Design in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified designated the whole and to replace concept and sound signifier (significant).

Correspondence of the conceptual meaning to their external form is mod relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation, it is not the inevitable.
