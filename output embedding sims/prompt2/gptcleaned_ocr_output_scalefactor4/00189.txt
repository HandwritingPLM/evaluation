4. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1) Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach interprets motivations and the eit pete eoe better, Turner and Katz (1974) concluded that different people have different needs for every different purpose. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. There are as many reasons that people use media as there are media users (Blumberg & Bate, 1974).

Social situation and the individual's background, such as experience, motivations, and education, influence people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motivations and gratifications for using different media. Mucall, Gunther, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interaction" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) personal identity: preference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) surveillance (awareness of important news or information). The audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974) based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotional stability of "growth" and "preservation". When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 2). Figure 1. A detailed listing of 16 general paradigms of human motivations (McGuire, 1974). Wartella, Gunter, and Has (1973) developed 04 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;

2. Affective needs, including emotions, pleasure, feelings;

3. Personal integrative needs, including finding and storing memories;

4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and

5. Tension release needs, including relaxation and diversion.

Similarly, McGuire's (1983) classification of the following common reasons for media use:

- finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society and the world;

- seeking advice on practical matters or personal and social decisions;

- gaining pure and simple entertainment and diversion; and

- expressing and receiving interest.
