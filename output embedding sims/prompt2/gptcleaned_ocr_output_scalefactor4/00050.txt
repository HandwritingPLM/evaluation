1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch. They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between audience needs and media use:

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of mass media use is assumed to be goal-oriented. Patterns of media use are shaped by more or less awareness of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience.

2. In the mass communication process, much initiative is creative in linking need gratification and media choice with the audience member. This places a limit on theorizing about any sort of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by mass communication constitute only a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the degree to which they can be adequately met through this channel certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - i.e., people are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their terms (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous research on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people to the media, they did not address the connections between these gratifications. They suggested that uses and gratifications research concern the social and psychological origins of needs, which generate expectations of the mass media or other sources leading to differential exposure or engaging in other activities, resulting in need gratification and other unintended consequences (Katz et al., 1974b, p. 20). The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation for building the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and gratifications is still based on Katz's initial analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in such an electronic information age when people have more options for media use.

Needs and Gratifications

Different perceptions of audience members' motives and self-perceived needs each emphasize motives and the self-perceived needs. It is concluded that different people can use the same communication messages for different needs.

Uses and gratifications are analyzed and are not the same for everyone. The same media content may gratify different needs for different people. There is not only one way that satisfies all needs; there are as many ways as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 78).

Each situation and individual's experience dictate what they want from media. When individuals are self-aware and can state their motives and apply them to media, McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) propose a model to classify four important media gratifications.
