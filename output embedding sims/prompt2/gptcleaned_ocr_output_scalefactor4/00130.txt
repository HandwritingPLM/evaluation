Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two
components: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.

The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "I propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifi√©) and
signifier (signifiant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1859, in F. de Saussure
edited, p. 37). The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not in a destined
relation, but rather, in an arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1972) argues that "language does
not reflect a preexisting and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences." According to Saussure, "meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g. synonyms), organized into a signifying system" (Barker,
2002, p. 23). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
game paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, let's consider the lead
ing sentence: "I went to a theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is established through a
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as theater, my, and girlfriend can
be substituted for by other signs in the base such as cinema, our, friend.
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure argues that
signs do not make sense by virtue of reference
but create meaning by reference to each other. Thus, meaning
is a social convention organized through the relations between signs (Barker, 2002, 28). It is central to Saussure's argument that red is meaningful in relation to the differences
ized into a sequence which generates
green, blue, amber, etc. These signs are then organized
in areas where the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
