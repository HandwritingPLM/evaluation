“he claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which eee
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
tempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
practitioner helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann,
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as

Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point
