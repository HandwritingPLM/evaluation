Early Influences

The concept of uncertainty is a significant factor in interpersonal communication. The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication:

1. Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. Festinger worked at various institutions such as the University of Rochester, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. Festinger's research followed Lewin's theories and focused on Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory explains how imbalances among cognitions can impact individuals. It allows for three relationships among cognitions: consonant, dissonant, and irrelevant. Social Comparison theory suggests that individuals seek feedback from others to evaluate themselves and may experience conformity pressures. Festinger's work on uncertainty and behavior was highly influential in the field of social psychology. 

2. Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz and worked with prominent psychologists such as Wolfgang Kohler and Max Wertheimer. Heider acknowledged the influence of Kurt Lewin on his work and research. Heider's work, although not directly derived from Lewin's, was significantly impacted by his mentor. Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later at the University of Kansas, where he spent the rest of his career. Heider's contributions to psychology and interpersonal communication are widely recognized.
