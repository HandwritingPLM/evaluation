Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974. They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of mass media use is seen to be goal-oriented... patterns of media use are shaped by more or less clear expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience.

2. In the mass communication process, much initiative in linking need gratification and media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on bringing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and behaviors.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. Mass communication constitutes but a segment, and the degree to which they function certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - i.e., people are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms.

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous research on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people to the media, they did not address the connections between these gratifications. They suggested that uses and gratifications research is concerned with the social and psychological origins of needs, which generate expectations of the mass media or other sources, leading to preferential exposure or engaging in other activities, resulting in need gratification and consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones. The studies by them and their colleagues laid a theoretical foundation for building more diverse and accurate research on this subject.

Needs and gratifications research emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Media content may serve different purposes for different individuals, depending on the situation and the individual's background, such as experiences and basic needs. People are aware of and can state their own motives for media use. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of media-person interactions to classify four important media gratifications.
