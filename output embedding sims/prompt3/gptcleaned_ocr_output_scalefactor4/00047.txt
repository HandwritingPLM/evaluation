Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uncertainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles A. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1979), recognized that reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty research. Heath and Bryan (2000) state: "One of the main reasons underpinning interpersonal communication is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty" (p.15). The study of information is essential in all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical developments in the field of interpersonal communication.

For which were a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication, Berger and Calabrese researches have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal communication process; they have also aimed to employ social psychological theories as a starting point (p.99). The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of interpersonal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began to focus on creating formal theories for a better understanding, rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Interpersonal communication has long been viewed as an interdisciplinary field. Interpersonal communication is often linked to studies in language, social cognition, and social psychology. Prior to the 1960s, a modest amount of research was completed under the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant (2000) marked this time as the origins of the field of interpersonal communication: "Particularly when researchers adopted communication as the central lens because they wanted to see it (Social Sciences and Humanities" p.1). The 1940s impacted the direction of the field. Research in psychology examined personalities and the influence of relationships on not only a person's self-image but also the resolution of problems, showing trends in humanistic psychology and social exchange theory, inspired the idea that relationships could be improved.
