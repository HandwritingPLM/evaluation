THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in Europe. Further, the prevalence of science has gone far beyond anything Adorno had seen in Europe. The closest thing to advertising in the United States was something with no correlative to fascist propaganda (Adorno et al., 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with the Princeton Radio Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical bias observed, stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political propaganda (Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not see eye to eye on empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop the idea of the culture industry.

The tie between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until December 1941. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hanns Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Döblin, and Bertolt Brecht, several of whom found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood movies must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany. These preconditions – Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industry – are all important to an understanding of his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

Enlightenment as Mass Deception

themselves as art. They were instead trash intentionally produced for mass consumption that Adorno referred to as Fordist. The principles of mass production in the contemporary era of capitalism were implemented in these tendencies based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl, 2005, p. 165). Mechanical reproduction epitomized by Hollywood films and the CBS radio network that had been featured in consumer culture and hit songs were based on formulas that encouraged conformity and standardization (Adorno et al., 2002, p. 102). Mechanical reproduction ultimately rendered art its own enemy, allowing for a homogenization and degradation of its value. 

The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

Film and radio did not bother to present themselves as art. They were instead a business and became an ideology to legitimize the status quo (Adorno et al., 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what the techniques used by Henry Ford were now applied to culture (Adorno, 2002, p. 101). Like religion, culture has been criticized as another form of social control (Bloch et al., 181; Horkheimer and Adorno, 1944). Adorno rejected the idea that culture needed to provide a defense of high art, instead asserting that culture should be the adversary of the status quo (Horkheimer and Adorno, 1944). Adorno was presenting a Marxist analysis instead, he notes in passing that the domination of the culture industry is the underminer of high art. The Culture Industry has bee criticized as defining avant-garde as high art that necessitates a defense, pitting it against mass culture.
