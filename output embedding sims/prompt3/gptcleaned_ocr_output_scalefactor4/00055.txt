Linguistic mechanism by speaking actors. The former is called by Saussure Structural linguistics. On two levels, the Systematic system and the Variation Langue and the latter parole. Langue is necessary to communicate and correspond to it. Indifferent to the material of the signal which comes it; speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 2007, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, langue, is the social convention or value shared through society which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. It is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention. The structure of language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to resist the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "I propose to retain the word sign so to designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified and signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1958, in R. Barthes (ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the concept meaning to the form are the relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation, but rather the arbitrary relation. It does not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but rather a result of conceptual and phonic differences. According to Saussure, meaning is produced along two axes, the syntagmatic and paradigmatic. The syntagmatic is produced through a process of selection, related through a series of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, an arrangement of signs organized into a signifying system (e.g., a sentence). The paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities, in selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, they must be related by the consensus of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic sentence: "I went to a theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is established through the linear combination of signs in their respective context and completed only when other signs in the paradigm can be substituted for by other. Crucially, signs do not make sense to each other. Thus, meaning is understood as a conventional organization through the relations between signs in relation to the world: rather, they generate meaning through the relations between signs (Barker, 2002, p. 29). It is created through the conventions of their usage within a particular context.
