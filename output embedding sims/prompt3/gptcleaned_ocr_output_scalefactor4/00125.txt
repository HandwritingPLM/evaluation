Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the synchronic system of the sign and the diachronic system of the code. By speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of elements necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signals which compose it, as opposed to it, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1987, p. 13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system with the social dimension. That structure level, langue, of the social convention of valid shared through society which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, speech is considered relatively inflexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, its essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thoughts. It is because speech is essentially a communicative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not to pure creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure categorizes the language system into two parts, signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through its form. The form is called the signifier which is the external part of language. For example, both the word "dog" in English or in Korean are the material form expressing the actual animal, how for a primary example. the concept in question, becomes the signified. To process to retain the word "sign" is to define it solely by signified and designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively the former. have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are apart (Barthes, 1987, p. 37). The correspondence of these concepts is not in the natural relationship, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is his idea that in language, Sausaurre (1960) argues that language has separated and to use it in order to construct meaning from affect a preexistent and external reality of independent objects. throughtion through a series of conceptual and phonetic differences that concept of significant The study of the table are produced through a process of selections and the subtle results of the suggestiness (e.g. associative) and the paradigmatic (e.g. syntagmatic), show that in a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic Semeikation system but a field of possible signs that can this rule of composition comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a chain of words that are placed with one another. Despite various possibilities in the semiotic and the paradigreic the selection is always against a political criterion the physical language of a set of signs. The synergetic or the under is fused with her. This sentence is pricolike the ordering of signs. The sine within the same semiotic system the paradigmatic, Saussure page basically intersects the cet points of each other. "Crucially, signs do not make sense by having corresponding objects but rather, they generate meaning by their unique pair a sign" (Barker, 2002, p. 2). It's essential to Saussure's claim that each sign can only be understood as a social convention organized around the pure evasion to other cf. These signs derive their cultural conventions of their usage within a particular mean.
