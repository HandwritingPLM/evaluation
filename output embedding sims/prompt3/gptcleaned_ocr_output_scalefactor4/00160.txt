Early Influences

Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.
The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce uncertainty.

1. Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but then followed Lewin to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research. Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of EVT. Berger is best known for Cognitive Dissonance Theory.

Cognitive dissonance theory posits that when beliefs are in conflict with each other, individuals experience a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition. Conversely, individuals may experience a consonant relationship, in which cognitions in question have no effect. Cognitive uncertainty has an element of anxiety as individuals seek to reduce uncertainty by seeking feedback from others. An individual usually seeks the opinion of others who are similar to themselves, which may result in conformity pressures. Berger expands on Lewin's theory by stating that "Festinger has suggested that people seek out similar others who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty about their behavior and/or opinions".

Festinger received the Scientist Award of the American Psychological Association and an award from the Society of Experimental Psychologists. His theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary studies. Festinger stated, "It will clearly be shown that cognitive dissonance, and in fact, all.b) Goer pit robs Cal

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in psychology in Europe, later moving to the United States where he worked for the remainder of his career at the University of Kansas. During his time in Europe, he worked with many psychologists and was influenced by Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized and paid tribute to Lewin's stimulating influence, which remained strong even in his own work. In 1928, Heider moved to the United States and began working at the University of Kansas, where he conducted groundbreaking research in the field of interpersonal communication.

These two theorists, Festinger and Heider, made significant contributions to the study of uncertainty in communication, and their work continues to influence contemporary research in the field.
