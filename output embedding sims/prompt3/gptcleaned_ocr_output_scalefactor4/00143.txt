Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the Culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been numerous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about "the commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, believing that "capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification" (Eagleton, 1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that "the diffusion of dominant ideology among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the system as a whole" (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno's idea of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during his time. While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for understanding the relations between industry and culture, some critics argue that today it weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 146-148). Thus, for some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry appears to be merely historical, if they in fact concede that it had any relevance at all.

It is clear that the idea of the culture industry is not a panacea for analyzing dominant ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, the idea of the culture industry works for its own ends. While it is true that the dominant ideology can co-opt modern technologies to propagate its message, there are still complexities in how the culture industry operates. For example, one seldom sees critical theories on platforms like MSNBC or Yahoo that critique the prerogatives of corporate America. A reexamination of the idea of the dominant ideologies in relation to mass communication media is necessary in order to theorize on the cultural industry's function.
