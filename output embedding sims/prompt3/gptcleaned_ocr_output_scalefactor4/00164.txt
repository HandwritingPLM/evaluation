Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's theory of language. According to Barthes, language is a means of communication, indifferent to the material of the signifier. He explains that langue covers the purely structural part of language; it constitutes the linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level of langue consists of convention or value shared through a society, which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is considered relatively flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is still bound by shared conventions, despite the fact that speech by an individual cannot be completely free from the social aspect of language. Language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is essentially a collective contract that one must accept entirely to communicate effectively. Because language is a system of contractual values, it resists modifications coming from a single individual and is thus a social institution. In contrast, speech is considered an individual act of selection and actualization, where the speaking subject can use the language code to express personal thoughts.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes language into two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signified is the concept or meaning expressed through the form, while the form itself is called the signifier, representing the external part of language. Saussure emphasizes the arbitrary relation between the signified and the signifier, rather than an inevitable internal connection. According to Saussure, language constructs meaning from within itself through a system of conceptual and phonic differences, operating through syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes. The syntagmatic axis refers to the arrangement of signs in a sequence like a sentence, while the paradigmatic axis encompasses a field of possible signs that can be interchanged. Saussure argues that signs do not create meaning by referring to an independent object in the world but through the relations between signifiers. These relationships generate meaningful differences that are then organized into a sequence reflecting cultural conventions within a specific context.
