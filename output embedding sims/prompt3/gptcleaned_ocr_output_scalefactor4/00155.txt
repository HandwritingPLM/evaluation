Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which composes it; as opposed to it, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 1967, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, langue, is the social convention or value shared through a social bond by which it is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression of the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be separate from the shared convention, the structure.

 A language is therefore, a social institution and a system of values. If it is the social part of language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially private: it is an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is essentially a communicative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-75).

 Diving further, which divides the language system into two parts, a and a which are the code system and expression system expressed through the form. The form consists of a signifier, which is the external part of language, seen in English words like 'dog' or 'more', are the external forms that carry the actual imprint of the concept in question. Barthes suggests "I propose to detach the signifier from the signified and to replace the concept and sound/image relation," meaning that the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the connection solely by means of each other and from the whole of which they are parts. The correspondence of the concepts lying in their mutual relations, may be seen in pictures. Saussure strongly argues that language is a process of selection and combination. According to Saussure, meaning is not a given thing, it is a process of selection from a paradigmatic field.
