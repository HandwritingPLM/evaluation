Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

The uses and gratifications approach is an alternative model in media etheory. The origination of the approach lies in the examination of how individuals fulfill their needs through media usage (Katz et al., 1974). Uses and gratifications approach puts the focus on the side of audience members, linking their needs and gratifications with media consumption. In contrast to traditional media theories that view audiences as passive recipients of information, the uses and gratifications approach views people as active participants who choose the media that best suits their needs (Severin & Tankard, 1997). The approach emphasizes audience choice by assessing their reasons for using certain media over others, as well as the various gratifications obtained from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements. From a broader perspective among communication researchers, it provides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants seek information or content selectively, in line with their needs and interests. Audience members then incorporate the content to fulfill their needs or satisfy their interests (Lowery & DeFleur, 1989).
