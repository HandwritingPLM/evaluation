Like Spears gestures scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1957, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the:
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified, "I propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (signifiant), the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sep-
arates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
