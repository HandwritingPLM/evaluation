THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had long been a privilege that had not been easy to penetrate. Furthermore, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something unique compared to in Europe. The changes leading to a deepening experience of the advertising industry in the United States resulted in propaganda (Rogers, 1982, p. 11). Rogers did not go into detail about his experience with the Princeton Media Research Project concerning the culture industry. However, starting in the other direction, he implied that his research aided advertising strategies for political propaganda. Horkheimer and Adorno were worried that Lazzarato and Silvio had emphasized the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project led him to further develop his ideas on the subject.

Members of the research group in California could not convince Adorno to join the West Coast with Max Horkheimer. When Adorno was finally able to return, he faced an unstable artistic community, involving Kurt Lang, Frank Sternberg, Moses Stern, Alfred Shaeffer, and Bernard Brill, all of whom had entered the Hollywood film industry. The fact that Adorno was unable to connect with members of the production of Malhuesal was a sore point. Adorno struggled with the process of improving his ideas on politics and the culture industry, which was the focus of his work.

For Adorno, popular culture and art do not combine into a coherent whole. They were disparate elements, and the public became an ideology to legitimize the trivial. They intentionally produce (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2016, p. 24). This practice was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist rationalization, where mass production, based on the techniques used by Henry Ford, was implemented in the cultural sphere, as these tendencies were centered on rationalization and hierarchy (McLellan, 1995, p. 242). Examples of such practices by Adorno include the Hollywood productions, for example, or the CBS radio network associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies and songs were formulaic, and the form overshadowed the content (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 3). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would be no real change in the system and that nothing subversive in the mainstream would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 106-107). Basically, any creativity would only require theater, and Adorno cited Orson Welles as an example of an artist allowed to break the mold. The illusion of diversity in the system would cover the absence of a real choice, ultimately rendering it meaningless (Friedman, 1984, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was a form of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 100), but freedom in choice is just another facet of economic coercion, ultimately resulting in the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 181).

Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as an adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 301). It was not high art that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culture industry, but modernism. Although he criticizes the domination of high art, Adorno provides a nuanced Marxist analysis. Instead, he argues that breaking free from the dominant ideological framework is key to the subversion of entertainment.

Although Adorno was seen as a defender of high art, The Culture Industry has been criticized as a denigration of high art, in contrast to popular culture. Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as an adversary of the culture industry (Adorno, 1991, p. 50).
