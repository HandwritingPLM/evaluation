MASS DECEPTION

1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything that had been seen in the past. Commercialization of culture in the United States was something with no correlative in Adorno's experience to the advertising industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his apprehension about the culture industry by noting the statistical undistinguishable from political division and stating that he saw this research as being industrial (ibid, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not see eye to eye on the satisfaction with propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 12). Adorno eventually left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction did ultimately motivate him to further develop the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project, which would lead to the idea of the culture industry. 

The strained relations between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University, especially with Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until November 1941. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Doblin, and Bertolt Brecht, several of which found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood movies must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture since the Hollywood system inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditions, Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industry are all important to an understanding of his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business, and this, in turn, became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 16). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hobendabl, 1995, p. 142). Examples of this were specified by Adorno were the Hollywood production system or the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplanted the work (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 84). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual (Friedman, 1981, p. 16). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 1979, p. 56). 

Adorno has been criticized as being an apparent defender of high art, Theodor Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the antithesis of the culture industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 101). He never explicitly provides an alternative to the culture industry, but he provides no overt Marxist analysis. Instead, he gives a strong nod towards the culture industry, noting that it serves as a giving force to culture (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 101). He recognizes that mass production for entertainment or relaxation is a necessary part of society.
