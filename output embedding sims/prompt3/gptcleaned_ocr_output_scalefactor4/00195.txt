1. Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratification approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes-
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different
individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people’s ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media person x
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (arms of informa-
tion seeking.

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation”. Overall, his model
included 16 different types of motivations when applied to media use (Figure 1).

Structuring of 16 general packages of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 55 needs based on the social and psychological functions of the mind. Media and
put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, involving acquiring information, knowledge and understanding
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings
3. Personal integrative needs, building credibility, reliability, stability
4. Social integrative needs, interacting with family and friends
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion

Concurrently, McQuail (1969) identified the following consumer functions for media use:

1. Finding out about his environment and conditions immediately and selectively
2. Making choices or plans about personal or opinion and decision matters
3. Seeking guidance by general interest
4. Attaining self-education
5. Gaining a sense of security through knowledge.
