OTHER PROMINENT PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1. Other Propaganda Theorists

(ii) Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda and discovering the effects of it. These research and analysis are done as explained in an essay entitled "Elements of Communication."

Lasswell (1946) explains that content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1960) aims to achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content to audience" (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell's (1952) early definition of communication which stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effect" (p. 169). Content analysis is essentially the "says what" part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this way, Lasswell created a credo whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them and is also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still the information that is affecting their decisions within the democratic system, and it is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann's theories.

(ii) Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda, Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928) defines propaganda as "a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a public in an enterprise, idea, or group" (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bernays recognizes that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning as a whole. Bernays states, "We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of... Virtually all human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society" (p. 9).

Based on these ideas that public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is necessary for society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of public relations. "Public relations is a very comprehensive, all-encompassing, adjustment, and engineering public support for an activity, cause, movement, or institution" (Bernays, 1955, p. 2). In the Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) lays out the framework for understanding the public and developing public relations campaigns. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relations campaign is the attitudes of various groups in society, gathering information effectively express an idea, and finally, utilizing persuasion to influence the public opinion as intended.

Bernays' theories represent a step forward for mass communication and the practice of public relations, moving toward a more sophisticated approach to shaping public opinion.
