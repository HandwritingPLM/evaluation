Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the public and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing (Seigenthaler, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase the engineering of consent. He said, "Engineering implies planning." And it is careful planning rather than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hype or sinister guileful propaganda (Bernays, 1935, p.1). Furthermore, Bernays' theories represent a different perspective on the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily shaped, Bernays believes that if attempting to influence the public, a business must study what forms the partnership can be more agreeable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, objectives, to the arena which the public understands and is willing to accept.

Bernays reshapes public relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations in a contemporary situation, helps the public to adjust to it (Bernays, 1952). As he recognizes the power of persuasion, Bernays limits the influence that is possible. Bernays (1952) states that public relations is important because it helps them to understand the interests to exert leadership in ways that persuade the public: it is still possible.

Lippmann and Ellul tended to divide to which we are all a part that affects. 

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories
Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Lippmann is also to be highlighted for bringing attention to the fact that the public can be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues lays the groundwork for a more thorough understanding of the influence of the media on the public. The theories developed by Lippmann and his peers helped shape a more recent research work. The study of media effects, based on the ideas of the press and the public in a democratic society continues to be explored by contemporary scholars. Recent research has focused on media functions such as gate-keeping, agenda-setting, agenda-building, and the role of the media in shaping public opinion and influencing other audiences.
The theories presented by Lippmann, Lasswell, and Bernays have been very influential in shaping our understanding of society today. Their contribution to our understanding of how propaganda could influence the masses through the media is significant.
