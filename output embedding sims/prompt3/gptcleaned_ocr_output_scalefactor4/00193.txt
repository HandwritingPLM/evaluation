I. RETURN TO GERMANY

Return to Germany

were published without their permission in the 1940s. The Institute received permission in 1949 for their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. They relocated to Frankfurt and became part of the University of Frankfurt. They looked at television that was the result of a Rockefeller Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner. Adorno protested distancing that could jeopardize their return to Germany. In the later 1950s, Adorno published a study that had been done for the Chancellor of West Germany and others. In his essay, Adorno transformed modern industries of culture into a medium of ideological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160). It was one of the major breakthroughs in the 1950s. The implications of Culture, at least one observer found it strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments. Adorno would nonetheless continue to influence thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he gave a radio talk in Germany on the practice and the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of the Culture Industry

Instead of culture serving ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society. Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent. The entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control. Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions. However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the social array. In the end, Marcuse's analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant ideologies. We can the administered individuals who have made their mutilation. Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individuals free themselves from their masters? How is it even thinkable that they free themselves from themselves as well?" It was somewhat ironic that largely because of his instance at the 1960s in the U.S. and Germany that developed an oppositional stance, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could into practice. For example, in 1961, Friedrich Pollock reported that the work continued to receive mass dissemination until 1969 and may have only agreed to republishing by individuals. Given the pessimistic tone of the book, in spite of it he would be perceived as an instance. In reviewing the capitalismers acquired too much by Fischer publishing house, the work was disseminated.
