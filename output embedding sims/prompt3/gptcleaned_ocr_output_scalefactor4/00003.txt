Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in how communication can be used by individuals to manage uncertainty.

Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication. In the late 1960s, Social Information Processing theory was developed at the University of California under the direction of Joseph Walther. Berger and Calabrese (1975), who were students of Kurt Lewin, Lewin, one of the founders of modern social psychology and a pioneer in research, had a substantial influence on the development of theories related to interpersonal communication.

Berger worked at the University of Iowa and then the University of California until 1945 when he followed Lewin to the Massachusetts Institute for Technology Research Center for Group Dynamics. Here Calabrese was highly influenced by the work of Lewin. Turmer (2000) reports that individuals who move away from the strong influence of their communication scholars may adopt one of three strategies to react to uncertainty.
