4. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1) Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach implicates that individuals use media for different purposes. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people have different needs for every different purpose. The same media content may satisfy different needs for different individuals. There isn't only one main purpose for media usage. There are as many reasons for media use as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

In addition, social environment, and the individual's background, such as experiences, interests, and education, influence people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can articulate their own motivations and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Gunter, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-participant interaction" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance: awareness of information. A more in-depth understanding of the audience's motivations was suggested by McQuail (1974) based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" involvement, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotion gratification of "growth" and "preservation." When combined, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 2). Figure 1. A diagram outlining 16 general paradigms of human motivations (McQuail, 1974). Williams, Gurevitch, and Has (1973) developed four needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into four categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;

2. Affective needs, including emotions, stimulation, feelings;

3. Personal integrative needs, including integration with family and friends; and

4. Tension release needs, including escape diversion.

Similarly, McQuail's (1983) classification of the following common reasons for media use:

* finding out about personal events and developments in immediate surroundings, society, and the world;

* speaking alone on practical matters or personal choices;

* recreation and entertainment interest;

* empathy and a sense of security through knowledge.
