1 Early Influences

Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.
The following is how academic can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce

uncertainty.

1 Early Influences
The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty theory.
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a
substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, he initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal
communication and on the theory. He at ke the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed COT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). COT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other, and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2011). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of and dis-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison explains that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2013. Berger and Calabrese related so-
cial comparison to COT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that people seek out similar others
who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 110). Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award from the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in
Festinger, 1980) stated, "It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has never been the same since" (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Vienna. Prior to
on, Heider worked with many renowned psychologists such as the Gestalt psychologists
and Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial
influence in psychology. Heider wrote, "I want, to acknowledge the immense debt
much of my thinking has to Kurt Lewin's work" (Heider, 1958, p.
vii). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of
Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).
