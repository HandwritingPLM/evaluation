Rogers was born in Carroll, lowa in 1951. He earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, the book has numerous communication projects in Korea and has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and some theory in such fields as geography, psychology, political science, and communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 and passed away from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005. According to Rogers (1955), diffusion refers to "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation shall be a practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels." Communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass communication are how people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation useful. Lasswell (1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, i.e., sender-message-channel-receiver. Rogers (1995) mentioned, "there is a model of communication that corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion." Specifically, (1) sender can be innovators or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally, the effects can be individual's adoption of social change. In the diffusion theory, "Time" variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1962), time variable is involved in diffusion in the innovation-decision process; innovativeness, and observability play a role in diffusion innovations have a s-shaped curve of adoption. Different research areas expand to explain how and why sender and audience seek information such as the influence of media message, interpersonal influences are important to the portrayal of the individual as well the value of analysis critically important factor in diffusion because more people express their opinions. The more they are responded to the more diffusion will occur. There are five different types of adopters according to innovation process: Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards (traditional) (Rogers, 1983, pp. 145). Rogers claimed that Early Adopters are more vital in adapting new ideas than other adopters. He discusses relationships between people and how they take part in the diffusion process. As noted above, diffusion process may vary in different cases and may differ in different cultures. Rogers (1962) asserted that progress is apart.
