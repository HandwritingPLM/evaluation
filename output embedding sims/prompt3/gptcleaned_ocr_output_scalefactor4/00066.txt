Rogers was born in Corpus Christi, Texas in 1931. He earned his Ph.D. from Iowa State University and worked on the Korean War. The book "Diffusion of Innovations" has become the standard work on communication projects in Korea as well as diffusion theory in such fields best book on diffusion theory as communication, geography, economics, psychology, and sociology. Rogers retired from his professorship at the University of New Mexico in 1975 and passed away on October 21, 1995, after suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 1995 in New Mexico. 

Rogers communicated through certain channels; diffusion refers to "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time" (p. 404). An innovation is an idea, practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. That is, by sharing communication channels such as mass media, interpersonal networks, or communication channels, people can get information about an idea. Social Chang 45) presented one possible conceptual model involving a source-message-channel-receiver-effect analysis of communication that is Irish shared considered five parts, S-M = C-R-E-T. 

Rogers (1995) mentioned, "the important concept of individual adopters or units of adoption can be specific.endeed as being new, interpersonal or other communication implies." Communication can be (1) interpersonal, (2) message content, (3) the effects of individual, which has a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995, the variable 'Time' is a critical component of an innovation's rate of adoption. Most diffusion researchers have attempted to explain the process of how and why individuals adopt new ideas. According to Rogers (1995), individuals can be inventors or opinion leaders that influence how and why an audience adopts a new idea. Individuals' adoption of social change. Individual, group, and societal influences are important in determining an individual's adoption of social change. In the diffusion theory, according to Rogers (1995), innovations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. 

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process: (1) Innovators, who are opened opportunities updated with new innovations first; (2) Early Adopters, who are respected by their peers and are more likely to adopt new innovations early; (3) Early Majority, who are more deliberate in their decision-making process; (4) Late Majority, who are skeptical about new ideas; and (5) Laggards, who are traditional and resistant to change (Rogers, 1995). Rogers defined this term as "the degree to which an individual is relatively early in adopting) new ideas compared to other gather members of his social system" (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). It shows the relationships among adopters divided which assists in the adoption curve. Figures of adopters by innovativeness and their place in the adoption curve.

When it comes to the process of innovation, there are five stages of innovation decisions: 

1. Knowledge (a perstepus potential uses)

2. Attitudes (of people where positive attitude towards innovation will |

be more useful than those with a negative attitude)

3. Adoption (precisions people decide individual)

4. Implementation (regulars evaluate the confirmation decision)

5. Confirmation (reinforcing application)
