Opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1953) regarding propaganda in influencing

the public. And it is careful planning (Koch, 198k) could potentially be a hit or miss (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, as propaganda is manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, "The public is not a mass to be fooled at will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, there are specific ideas that the public must study to understand and be willing to accept. It must explain itself, its aims, and the ways in which the public can benefit. Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1942). Rather than merely manipulating the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The object of public relations can help his client adjust to the contemporary situation or help the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 6). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann as he recognizes the power of society but also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1962) writes of the benefits of public relations, stating that "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts being made by others, and to persuade on suggested courses of action" (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is more in terms of ignorance of public opinion. Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with his point.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann and others were at attention due to the fact that the public is able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has led to recent research that is meant to help understand the influence of the media on the public. Alongside Lippmann, other researchers such as McQuail, Gerbner, Kinder, Westley, Lasswell, White, Combs, and Shaw have contributed to understanding the effects of the media on their audiences.

The theories presented in the paper have been heavily influenced by the ideas of Ellul, who tended to push beyond the thoughts of the majority to a more critical view of media. There is still much to be explored in this area that should be pursued for future research.

Even through the work of Lippmann, limited effects were shown to be present in media models. Theorists such as Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul have continued to examine the honesty that surrounds both public relations and propaganda. While the theories of manipulation of the public help us understand the ways in which the media can influence, they also remind us of the importance of being well-informed.
