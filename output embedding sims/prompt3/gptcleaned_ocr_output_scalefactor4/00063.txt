I. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the social influence of strategic planning for Social judgment played a considerable role in shaping the field of social psychology. By the 1970s, research pioneers such as Festinger, relational development theory, and research into the control processes were influenced by scholars like Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Sorokin. This, along with research into behavior, such as the work of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger (2005), helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past two decades. Today, interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. Since its introduction in the field, uncertainty reduction has been recognized as a crucial element in interpersonal processes, driving the field's development.

Uncertainty has been a recognized major field of study in communication as a whole. This chapter aims to focus on the study of uncertainty reduction in communication, which has been vital to the development of interpersonal communication as a whole and central to understanding interpersonal processes.

The shift into the realm of social interest occurred as Berger and Thibaut, during the later part of the decade, became popular figures in the field. Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty is identified as a critical concept essential to the study of communication, it is beneficial to understand its origin and definition. One approach to considering uncertainty lies in the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) suggested that uncertainty exists when there are numerous possible alternatives with relatively equal probabilities in a given situation. They related this view of uncertainty to message transmission, contributing to the development of Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT). Berger and Calabrese (1975) extended uncertainty to interpersonal communication, defining it as the number of potential alternative behaviors each interactant might exhibit. The higher the uncertainty in a situation, the harder it is to predict behaviors and events. High uncertainty in relationships can hinder relational growth, leading to stress and anxiety, impacting communication effectiveness. Incredi3le can increase predictability, but excessively hamper a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) mentioned that excessive predictability can numb a relationship.
