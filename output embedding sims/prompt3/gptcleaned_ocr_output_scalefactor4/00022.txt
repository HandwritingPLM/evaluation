THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

The commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything seen in Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative in Europe. The closest thing in Adorno's experience to the advertising industry in the United States was fascist propaganda (Jaeger, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with the Princeton Radio Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical division of consumers, noting that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002).

Horkheimer and Adorno did not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno’s dissatisfaction with the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University, which would bring Adorno to the West Coast where he joined an expatriate community that included Herbert Marcuse, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, and Alfred Döblin who were also working in the Hollywood movie industry.

For Adorno, popular culture was not to be treated as art. Instead, they were seen as mass-produced commodities that intentionally produced distraction and false happiness for the masses (Adorno, 1991, p. 5). Adorno argued that this process was facilitated and perpetuated by the culture industry through standardization and hierarchy (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002).

Adorno specifically criticized the culture industry for creating an illusion of choice and freedom for individuals, while in reality, it restricted their true agency and creativity (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002). Adorno did not believe that the culture industry was a liberating force, but rather a mechanism that reinforces existing power structures and control over individuals.

Adorno saw popular culture as a silent weapon that served to maintain the status quo by offering a false sense of satisfaction and stability to individuals, ultimately rendering it ineffective in facilitating real social change. Adorno believed that the dominance of the culture industry allowed it to assume the role of a new form of social control that masked itself as a source of entertainment and leisure (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002).
