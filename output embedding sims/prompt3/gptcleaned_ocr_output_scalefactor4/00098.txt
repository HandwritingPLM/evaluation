Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industry, are all important to an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business, and this, in turn, became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 45). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl
1995, pp. 142). Examples of this, as specified by Adorno, were the Hollywood production system,
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supports the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. 85). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change but rather
that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, pp.
106-107). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system and it was difficult for
anything truly new or a piece
to break the rules. Elasticity in the system would
help it adapt.
