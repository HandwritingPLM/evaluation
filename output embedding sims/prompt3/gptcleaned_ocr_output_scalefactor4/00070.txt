Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in affecting public opinion (Bernays, 1935), Bernays (1985) himself made a statement regarding his purpose, the art of content. He said, "Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time bluster or mass popularity and propaganda" (Bernays, 1985, p. x). Furthermore, Bernays' theories also represent a different view of the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, "The public is not an amorphous mass which can be molded at will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1938) offers the idea that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be made amicable and mutually beneficial, it must explain its aims, its objectives, to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 65).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in "Public Relations" (1952). Rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, and he helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1985, p. 8). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of society, but still claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, "To citizens in general, probe ongoing is important because it helps them understand the society of which we are all a part, and evaluate the viewpoints of others, exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, evaluate efforts being made by others, and persuade or suggest courses of action" (p. 1). Within this framework, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of public opinion. Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tend to disagree with this point.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippman, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the idea of mass persuasion, they were able to bring attention to the fact that the public can be influenced by the media. The work of Lippman and his colleagues has led to a more recent measure that is meant to help understand the media's impact on the public. Through the work of Jamieson and Waldeter, as well as Gehstedt and McCambridge and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of the possible effects such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects that these techniques can have on the audience.

The theories presented in this paper have tested both the direct effects and indirect effects of media models. Theorists such as Ellul extended his model, whereby propaganda could directly influence thought and action, similar to Lippmann who noted that the media might not only be influencing thought but also dictating what people think about. This thinking led to further research on the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were showcased through the work of Iyengar and Binder, as well as McCambridge and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in this paper has been very important for the understanding of the media, the generalization of the public, and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
