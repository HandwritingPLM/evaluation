These preconditions Adorno's interest. In music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the

his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of this not specified by Adorno were the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies

and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplanted the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,

2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any radical change to en
