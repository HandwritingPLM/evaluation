Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of Lippmann, who was able to bring attention to the fact that the public can be influenced by the work of Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more recent research that seeks to understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the work of Langer and Hiner, White, Innis, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of the media has been developed. The public has now been made aware of serious influences such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potentially powerful effects that these techniques can have on audiences.

Furthermore, theorists like Lippmann have suggested that the media may not only influence what people think, but may also influence if they think about certain topics. This type of thinking has paved the way for future research in the field. In the early days, limited effects were shown through the work of some theorists, but overall, the research of the scholars mentioned in this paper has been instrumental in understanding the role of the media in shaping public opinion.

The theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and others have been instrumental in helping us understand the society that surrounds us.
