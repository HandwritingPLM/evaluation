DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title The Social Influence, examines small group processes. Theories include uncertainty, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2002). Berger is considered a forefather of social psychology along with Kelhew and Howland. By the 1960s, research in the field of uncertainty was being furthered by Spence and Knodel. Their work influenced the field significantly, paving the way for future studies on uncertainty.
