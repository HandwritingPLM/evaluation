1. Early Influences

The following theorists significantly influenced the field of communication. The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of communication theory (Palidu & Valabreski, 1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied the substantial influence of social psychology and was a pioneer in the psychology of group dynamics. He had a significant relationship with Kurt Lewin, a prominent figure in social psychology. After graduation, Festinger followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Festingerâ€™s research on Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison Theory were highly influential on the emerging field of psychology. Festinger is best known for his theory of cognitive dissonance, which explains how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Festinger received the Distinguished Scientist award from the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. His legacy continues to influence contemporary social science research (Aronson, 1980).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz. During his time in Europe, Heider worked with many renowned psychologists such as Wolfgang Kohler, Max Wertheimer, and Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, acknowledged Lewin's substantial impact on his life and work. Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of Kansas, where he spent the remainder of his career (Ash, 2004).
