1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

In the realm of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
social group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance,
facial judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2006). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of each scholar
- Reape, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade
and into the 1950s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Blankenship, Real, and Berger became popular
along with research in behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Aucoin, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) states: "these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research
agenda during the past nine decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the developmental, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been posited that
interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction in the 1960s, uncertainty has been regarded as a separate field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communications as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
on those theories which cloned the perchance of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and in general in our
understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, especially in the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when
there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this variety of uncertainty in the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of uncertainty. Berger and Calabrese (1975) responded to the
information theorists as well as Heider (1950) research on attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty for interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the "number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 800). The presence of
the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions, individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way
that they do. Berger and Floyd's (1987) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of the
process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternatives
things that a stranger can hold â€” of potentially many" Uncertainty plays a significant role in inter-relationships Higher levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Research has indicated
that a sense of uncertainty may prevent the formation of competent communicative competencies. Turner and West (2010) note that individuals may not be able to develop relationships or may not be able to maintain social interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty cause
clearer verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking. In inter-
actions, it is expected that individuals who experience predictability will lead to the ability to
actions of individuals in what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty arises it is often
no longer valued, although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty
hinder the ability to sustain a relationship. Houser and Bryan (2000) write: "Too much certainty
and predictability can dull a relationship."
