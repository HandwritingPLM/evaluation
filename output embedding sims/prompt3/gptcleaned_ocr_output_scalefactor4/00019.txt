ere published without their permission in 1940, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late 1960s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1969. Horkheimer became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1964 Adorno published an essay entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a survey that had been done for the Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerber and others. In this essay Adorno warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed of psychological control (Adorno, 1994, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1960s that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments of the times (Jager, 2004, p. 190). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape his thoughts on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture in the United States (Adorno, 1994, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1965 on The Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film, Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1966, p. 131).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 648). Instead of culture serving ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society is the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Richter, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of affluent affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 53) in an ideology where mainstream perspectives were set around an ecology that maintained that communication, entertainment, and satisfaction be separate areas.

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information available could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions. It was difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture or ideology from the brutality of dominant ideology in the same way the previous analyzers of society allowed for no opposition to the domination they had done. In the end, Marcuse argues that individuals have made their mutilations become their satisfactions, and these reproduce on an enlarged scale from their other masters. How can they ever think critically? (Marcuse, 1968, p. 241) Given the pessimistic tone of the text since mid-20th-century sociopolitical shifts in the US and Germany that have indicated hopelessness in thought, Marcuse, a philosopher, and sociologist, offers an alternative to the German philosophical tradition associated with Frankfurt School.

In contrast, he also touches upon the idea that theory could be translated into practice often associated with French poststructuralists like Foucault and Derrida. It is interesting to note that the above accounts reported to Adorno and Horkheimer about the Institute suggest that the two authors published their work willingly in 1940, and may have only agreed to republication with the Fischer Verlag that had already been suggested by individual associations.
