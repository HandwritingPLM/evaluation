Patterns of media use are shaped by definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer to the audience. In the media ecology theorizing, media are considered as agents of behavior. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction but are not the sole provider. The degree to which they can be substituted certainly varies.
Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves. People are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their media use in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.
In addition, Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch detected significant differences in audience needs fulfillment.
