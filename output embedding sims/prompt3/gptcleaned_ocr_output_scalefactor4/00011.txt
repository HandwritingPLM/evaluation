Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the public and public opinion are essential. The role of propaganda in influencing public opinion is a critical aspect of public communication (Curtin, 1995, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding the engineering of consent. He said, "Engineering implies planning in advance and it entails a careful understanding of what changes in a society must be made to ensure modern public relations frames old-time hit or miss publicity and relies on 'fact-finding processes'." (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays' theories also represent a different view of manipulation in society in opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily influenced by propaganda. He argues, "The public is not an amorphous mass which can be molded as believed by Lippmann." (Bernays, 1955, p.60). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in order to influence the public, a business must understand what terms the partnership can be on and how it can be mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, and objectives to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to align the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations practitioner helps his clients adjust to the contemporary situation or assists the public in adjusting to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann as he recognizes the power of society, yet still acknowledges that the manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes about the benefits of public relations: "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them understand the society to which we all belong, to know and evaluate the viewpoints of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts made by others, and to persuade or suggest courses of action" (p. 10). Under this framework, while the manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not done in ignorance of public opinion. Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for numerous reasons. Lippmann's work drew attention to how the public can be influenced by the media. The work of Lasswell and his contemporaries, along with recent research, aims to understand the influence of the media on public opinions. Works by Iyengar, Kinder, White, Bennett, and McCombs and Shaw have advanced our understanding of the role of media in agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and framing, and the resulting effects on audiences.

The theories presented in this paper offer a range of perspectives and theoretical models. Theorists have focused on both direct and indirect influences of media on public attitudes and behaviors. Individuals like Ellul have emphasized the potential negative effects of media manipulation, while others, including Bernays, have proposed ways to align the interests of the public and those seeking to influence them. The discourse around the limited or extensive effects of media on the public is central to the role of communication in society, and this paper highlights the importance of considering these varying viewpoints.

In conclusion, the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays have helped shape our understanding of the role of media in society and continue to influence public discourse today. Through a blend of historical analysis and contemporary research, these theories have informed how communication strategies are formed and how public opinion is shaped.
