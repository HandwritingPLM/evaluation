Needs and Gratifications

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows.
They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of mass media use is
assumed to be goal-oriented ... patterns of media use are shaped by more or less
clear expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience.

2. In the mass communication process, much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
theorizing about any form of a straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - i.e. people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous research on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people to the media, they did not address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifications research is concerned with the following aspects: "1) the social and psychological origins of 2) needs which generate 3) expectations of 4) the mass media or other sources which lead to 5) differential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in 6) need gratification and 7) other consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones" (Katz et al., 1974b, p. 20). The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation for building the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and gratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in such an electronic information age when people have more options for media use.

1. Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's ideas about what they want from the media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important media gratifications.
