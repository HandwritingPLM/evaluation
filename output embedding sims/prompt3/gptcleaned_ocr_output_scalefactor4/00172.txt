were published without their consent. In fact, much of their propaga[n]da was being written by Horkheimer and Adorno. Once the Institute relocated to Frankfurt after their return to Germany, they established the Chair of Social Research at the University of Frankfurt. In 1954, Adorno published an essay on television that was sponsored by the Hacker Foundation, with the initial result of a study involving George Gebauer and others. In this essay, Adorno discusses the implications of the commodification of culture into a medium of unprecedented control (Adorno, 2011, p. 51). Adorno, as a leading theorist of his day, did not participate in the celebration of mass culture. Instead, he critiqued the culture industry. For instance, he wrote on jazz and cinema in the United States (Adorno, 1994, p. 21) and gave a critical analysis of universal parodic culture in his work *The Culture Industry Reconsidered*. In 1966, writing from Germany, Adorno conceded that filmmaking might be an alternative within the context of the culture industry, distinct from the modernist perspective (Horkheimer, 2005, p. 6).

2 One-Dimensional Man and Suppression of the Culture Industry

Marcuse presented a critical analysis of late capitalist society as a systematic critique, distinct from other Frankfurt School writers (Wiggershaus, 1994). Rather than viewing culture as a serving for ideological purposes, Marcuse argued that social control mechanisms had developed in the advanced industrial society, leading to the wholesale integration of market economies with societal organization (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist production and wealth accumulation created a system of rewards and complacencies (Alvar, 1955, p. 33). The affluence that upheld societal goals also contributed to maintaining an ideology that perpetuated dominance and control over individuals through indoctrination of consumerism and commercialism. Adorno and Marcuse both questioned whether mass culture could be differentiated from its manipulators and whether it was possible to distinguish culture from mass ideology, as Adorno stated "a tie that binds culture to mass" (Marcus, 1971, p. 24). However, it was not straightforward due to the intertwining of media within the whole, as society had become organized around an ideology that aimed to sustain social transformations and power structures. Marcuse pondered how individuals could break free from themselves and their manipulation. It seemed unimaginable that this cycle could be broken. While Marcuse acknowledged the possibility of this liberation on a larger scale, he envisioned an oppositional role for philosophers in the US and Germany, proposing a unified resistance against conformism. Unlike other members of the Frankfurt School, Marcuse advocated for a distinct approach to both theory and practice. It is notable that while Marcuse is often associated with the Frankfurt School, he was never officially a member. In fact, he went on to develop his own distinct path in philosophy. 

It is somewhat ironic that, despite being associated with the Frankfurt School, Marcuse chose to pursue a more practical approach. In 1940, he published his seminal work *Reason and Revolution*, which already laid out his revolutionary ideas. It would seem that since the early days of the Frankfurt School, there were internal discussions regarding individual contributions and the need for innovation. This eventually paved the way for Marcuse to develop his distinct philosophical standpoint.
