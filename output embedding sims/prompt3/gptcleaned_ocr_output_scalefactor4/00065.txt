4. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Needs and Gratifications

The gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the Me a aanter anal Kxtz (1974) concluded that different people can use the aye aU da ae
same message for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different individuals. There is not only one way that people are as there are media users (Blumler, 1979).
It is the personal needs and the individual's background, such as social (pacts tabs) education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media est ie Has
meets those needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and erc
for using different media. McChuail, Blurmler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person
interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion; escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value re ition seeking).
Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by MeGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus

self-perceived needs of audience mem ics; companionship; social rei

inforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa-

"internal" goal orientation, and emotion stability of "growth" and "preservation." When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (MoGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;

2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status,

4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.
