1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the latter part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Rolloff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Paterson. Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is mediated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on the theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is central to our understanding of interpersonal processes.

DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1947) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but they also contributed to the development of IET. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger expanded the concept of uncertainty in interpersonal communication by defining it as one of the ways in which each interactant views the amount of uncertainty in a situation, the smaller the chance of certain behaviors and occurrences. During interactions, individuals are seen not only predicting present and past behaviors but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1987) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of the process when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the sheer number of alternative things that might occur” (pp. 100). Uncertainty plays a significant role in maintaining relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely impact relational development due to fears and anxieties which come from low levels of communicative competence and esteem (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) described uncertainty as “a person’s inability to predict and explain what another person might behave” (pp. 100). The greater the uncertainty, the more that behaviors and interactions are impacted. Increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, decreased levels of intimacy and trust, and heightened predictability are all factors individuals are expected to increase with the greater levels of uncertainty. When high uncertainty is present, it becomes difficult to reach this goal. Although individuals seek to reduce the level of uncertainty, high levels of uncertainty can create ongoing concerns and challenges in relationship development. Heath (1984) and Levant (2000) stated: “Too much certainty is likely to reduce interest in the relational interaction.”
