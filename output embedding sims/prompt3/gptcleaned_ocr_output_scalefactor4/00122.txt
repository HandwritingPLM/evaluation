Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding the theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for several reasons. Based on the ideas of their predecessors, these theories bring to light how the public can be influenced by the media. Recent research, such as the work of Fungar and Kinder, White, Lerner, and McCombs and Shaw, provides a comprehensive understanding of propaganda and its various effects.

The scholars discussed in this paper, including Fungar, Kinder, and McCombs and Shaw, have contributed to the understanding of media manipulation. While theorists like Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point, Lasswell, Bernays, and others in this paper acknowledge the potential influence of propaganda on public opinion. It is not only limited to thought but also extends to behavior. 

Additionally, it is noted that the media may also play a pivotal role in shaping future research in this area. This line of thinking can impact research in the future as seen through the work of different scholars. Such limited effects were shown through various studies and discussions of the limitations of media influence.

The work of these scholars continues to help us understand the manipulation of public opinion and how propaganda affects society. The theories and insights developed by these theorists are still relevant today in understanding the complexities of public opinion and how it can be influenced in various ways.
