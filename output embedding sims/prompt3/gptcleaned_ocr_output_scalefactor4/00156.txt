I. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS 

1. Needs and Gratifications 

Uses and gratifications approach 

(1974) concluded that different purposes for using the media exist due to individual needs, social situation, and the individual's affective needs. That is, people have different needs for the media based on their unique characteristics. Contrarily, there are common motives for using different media. Bularz and Brown (1979) classify four major media gratifications or uses: emotional release, personal relationships, escapism, self-esteem, and reality exploration. These gratifications help individuals meet their needs and aspirations for media content. 

From media of escape, investigation of self-conception, and reality exploration. 

People have different motivations for using different media, which can be subdivided into the theory of human needs. The theory distinguishes between two types of needs: cognitive-affective needs. Three dimensions of needs were added: active external goal orientation, passive internal goal orientation, and intention. A distinction was made between the goals of growth and preservation. Charting these factors yields 16 different types of audiences that correspond to media use (Figure 1). The motivation of individuals comes from the social and psychological functions of media. Therefore, increasing self-awareness, satisfying social needs, and tension release are crucial.
