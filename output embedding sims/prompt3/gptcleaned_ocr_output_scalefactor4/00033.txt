Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications, according to Blumler and Katz, emphasize that perceived media needs can be varied for different individuals. The same communication medium can serve very different purposes for different people.

There is not only one way to fulfill many different needs for different people. Using the Uses and Gratifications Theory, researchers have focused on understanding how individuals select and utilize media in order to fulfill their needs. That is, audiences choose from and engage with media based on which best satisfy their differing motives and desires.

Blumler and Katz (1974) identified several gratifications, including: (1) Diversion: escape from everyday problems; (2) Personal relationships: using media for social interaction; (3) Personal identity: self-reference and enhancement; (4) Surveillance: staying informed on current events.

Another subdivision of audience motivations was proposed by McGuire (1972) drawing from a general theory of human motives. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective, adding dimensions of "active" versus "passive" engagement, "selective" versus "comprehensive" attention, and "internal" versus "external" goals. Depending on the stability of "growth" and "preservation," different types of motivations can be charted, which apply to various media (Figure 1).

McGuire (1972) developed 35 needs derived from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and categorized them into five groups:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, or understanding.
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, or fantasy.
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, or status.
4. Social integrative needs, including companionship or socializing.
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Furthermore, McGuire's (1969) classification of the following common goals for media use are:

- Finding out about relevant events and situations in immediate surroundings, society, and the world.
- Seeking advice on practical matters or opinions and decisions.
- Satisfying curiosity and general interest.
- Learning and self-education.
- Gaining a sense of security through knowledge.
