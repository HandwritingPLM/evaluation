1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson. Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication, since its introduction in the 1970s, has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important concept in communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of uncertainty. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the information theorists as well as Heider (1956) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adapted the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the "number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 1). The greater the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this issue when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things one can believe or potentially say." Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can lead to lower levels of communicator competence (West & Turner, 2000), as individuals may not be able to develop relationships or may be tense in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty caused an increase in verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking. In interpersonal interactions, increased levels of certainty are expected to increase predictability with the goal that this will lead to the ability to anticipate what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty exists it is often difficult to predict the other's goal. Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty can also inhibit a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “Too much certainty particularly can deaden a relationship, necessary to the study of communication, originated, and how it has been defined. (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
