Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p. 22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase, the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p. 22). Furthermore, Bernays' theories also represent a different view of the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, "The public is not an amorphous mass which can be molded at will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be made amicable and mutually beneficial, public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in "Public Relations" (1952). Rather than merely attempting to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts being made by others, and to persuade or suggest courses of action" (p. 10). Under this framework while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion.

Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a few reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring authentic and the public is able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues led to a deeper understanding of the public. Through the recent research that is meant to better understand the influence of the media on the public are the work by Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding. The various media functions have been developed has not been made aware of...

Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul noted that the media might not be influencing thoughts directly. Propaganda could directly influence the thought of the public, but may also be influencing what is starting point for future research. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for research. The limited effects of the media were shown through the work of... Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in the paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public. This paper has been a lot of work with many theorists in the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us. were formed years ago.
