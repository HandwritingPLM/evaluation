1. RETURN TO GERMANY

were published without their permission in 1940. Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing
themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late
1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951, Horkheimer
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1964 Adorno published an essay
that was the result of a study that had been done for the correction of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
transformed modern mass culture into a medium of unprecedented
psychological ease (Horkheimer, 2001, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s
that Adorno would delve into the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
(Marcuse, 1974, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on certain attempt to reshape
industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture
(Marcuse, 1981), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1966 on The
when writing the essay Transparency in Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1985, p. 151).

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wonders whether the alienation aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their functional functions
(Marcuse, 1961, p. However, it is difficult to argue separate culture
or mass media from sincerity as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end, Marcuse’s analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology. Marcuse wrote, “how can the administered individual
into their own Who are and satisfy and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scale liberate
themselves from themselves as well as from their mouths? How is it even thinkable that the
vicious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1961, p. 280). Given the pessimistic tone of the work,
it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist
movements of the 1960s in the US and Germany that developed an opposition
In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others
associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated
into practice (Chambers, 1983, p. 320).

In reviewing the text in 1961, Friedrich Pollack reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that the
work required too much revision to pass dissemination. The two authors continued to negotiate with the Fischer publishing house until Li, and may have only agreed to republish
the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals.
