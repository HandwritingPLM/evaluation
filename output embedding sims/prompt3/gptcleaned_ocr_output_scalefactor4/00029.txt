The following theories significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
Certain ideas of these works can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1) Leon Festinger (1919-1999)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a strong influence on Festinger initially.

Interpersonal communication and the development of Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) and Social Comparison Theory (SCT) attempted to explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1957). CDT allows for three relationships: consonance, in which cognitions are in equilibrium; dissonance, in which cognitions are in conflict with each other; and irrelevance.

To evaluate the conflict, the individual seeks the opinions of others who are similar to themselves. This need for social comparison can result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1974) related social comparison to SCT by stating that "Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation" (p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's legacy is significant, and his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. As Festinger (1957) stated, "It was in his era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since" (p. 3).

1.2) Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz. During his time in Europe, Heider worked with prominent psychologists such as Wolfgang KÃ¶hler, Max Wertheimer, and Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, acknowledged Lewin as having a significant impact on his life: "I want to pay tribute to Lewin's stimulating influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which is still strong even in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work" (Heider, 1928, p. vii). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of Kansas, where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 1984).
