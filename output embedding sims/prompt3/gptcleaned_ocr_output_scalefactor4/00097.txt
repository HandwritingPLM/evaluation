Her structuralist scholars, such as Barthe and Saussure, the linguistic mechanism of structural linguistics operates on two levels, governed by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematic system within the social dimension, the structure level, shared through society, which is stabilized and standardized. This is the actual expression at the individual level. However, the fact remains that speech by an individual cannot be free from the language is a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. Because language is a system that resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and a system, speech is an individual act of selection and actualization. Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes between the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning while the form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, the word "dog" in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. It designates the whole and to replace the concept and sound signify the signifier. Saussure argues that it is essentially the use of the code because speech is a personal act and not a pure language system. Language is considered a social system divided into two parts: the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic. The syntagmatic means a chain of signs or the underlying sequential order, while the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be selected. In the syntagmatic, the selection is regulated by linear logic, while in the paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic statuses. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, consider the sentence "I went to a restaurant with my girlfriend." This sentence can be transformed into "I went to a restaurant with her" by replacing "girlfriend" with "her" based on other signs in the paradigmatic such as "her" denotes the girlfriend. Saussure posits that signs are generated by the relation between signs rather than reference to entities in reality and are organized through their relations with each other in a system of conventions. These signs are then organized into a system that gains meaning through cultural practices and conventions.
