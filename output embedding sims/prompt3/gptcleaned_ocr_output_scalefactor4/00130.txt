Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.

The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “I propose to retain the word sign (signe) to designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and signifier (signifiant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1859, in FL Innis fed), p. 37). The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not in the destined relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1920) argues that "language does not reflect a preexistent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Saussure, "meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g. synonyms), organized into a signifying system" (Barker, 2002, p. 23). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the game paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the Leading sentence: “I went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through a linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as theater, my, and girlfriend can be substituted for by other signs in the base such as cinema, friend, etc. 

Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure argu  that signs do not make sense by virtue of reference but create meaning by reference to each other. Thus, meaning is a social convention organized through the relations between signs (Barker, 2002, 28). It is central to Saussure's argument that red is meaningful in relation to the differences between signs reorganized into a sequence which generates been, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized within the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
