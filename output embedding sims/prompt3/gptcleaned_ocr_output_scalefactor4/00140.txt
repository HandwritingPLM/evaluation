"Chapter 4: The Role of Developing Relationships in Interpersonal Communication Generally
Introduction
This chapter focuses on developing relationships in interpersonal communication.
However, the development of interpersonal communication is. Since it is implied action in the conversational tree.

Techy, Interpersonal communication tasks are indispensable for TEFL development.
However, uncertainty has helped in the development of the field of STC at a global level. This chapter strives to discuss the theorists who pioneered the reasoning for uncertainty and seduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is central in our understanding of interpersonal relationships.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important component of the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know where the concept originated and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1945) proposed that uncertainty exists in a given situation when there are a high amount of possible alternatives and the probabilities of these alternatives are relatively equal. In the transmission of messages, Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty, which also contributed to the development of UCT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) made â€” important --

Airs Hedder (1959) focused on attributions. Barger and Calabrese (1975) formulated uncertainty as an idea related to communication, and expanded the concept of uncertainty to further indicate the number of alternative ways in which individuals can evaluate uncertainty that exists in a situation. The smaller the number of occurrences during interactions, individuals are able to interact and react to uncertainty that exists in a situation, while a larger number of occurrences make it difficult to predict behavior. However, explaining why people behave or believe in certain ways. Individuals are expected to engage in more dynamic and explanatory behavior in initial interactions, as well as increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, in order to predict the actions of others. Uncertainty can greatly inhibit the development of relationships. High levels of uncertainty can hinder the potential for the development of communication competence and threaten the quality of interpersonal relationships as well as society. Individuals may not be able to develop relationships or may maintain incompetent communication habits and roles. Higher levels of uncertainty in initial interactions lead to an inability to predict behavior and difficulty in communication. High levels of uncertainty make it challenging to achieve cooperation. Uncertainty plays a significant role in relational development. Uncertainty of what is uncertain and unpredictability can severely inhibit a relationship. Uncertainty can hinder the development of relationships. High levels of uncertainty can inhibit the ability of communication competence to develop effectively. In contrast, lower levels of uncertainty can lead to increased verbal and nonverbal behavior that will, in turn, increase predictability with regards to individual actions. Individuals are expected to engage in future interactions, meanwhile a greater sense of uncertainty is expected to lead to difficulty in achieving this goal. A relationship between uncertainty, high levels of uncertainty, difficulty in maintaining a high degree of cooperation, and predictability can ultimately inhibit a relationship.
