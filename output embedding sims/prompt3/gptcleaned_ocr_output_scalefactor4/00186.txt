The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of the influences of their work can be seen reflected in the subsequent theories:

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the field of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1947 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed several of Festinger's theories were highly.

His theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary communication. Festinger (2000) stated, "It was in that era that Leon Festinger, cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, some psychological theory became the game changer."

1.2) Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Vienna in Europe. Heider worked closely with many prominent psychologists like Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial person of his work: "I want to pay tribute to Lewin's stimulating influence." In Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of Kansas, where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).
