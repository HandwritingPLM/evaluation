An important part of mass media use is shaped by more than Mass Communication and the degree to which it is met through media consumption.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - i.e., people are sufficiently self-aware to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

Value judgments about the audience are made while audience members are engaged in other activities.

In addition, Kind and Gunther also commented that, although previous research focused on the media, they did not address connections between uses in other unrelated areas.
