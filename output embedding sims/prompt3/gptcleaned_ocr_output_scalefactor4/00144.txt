1, THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything Adorno had seen in Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was higher than in Europe. The closest thing in Adorno's experience to the advertising industry in the United States was fascist propaganda (Jäger, 2011, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop the idea of the culture industry.

Because of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University, Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until November 1941. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Döblin, and Bertolt Brecht, several of whom found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood movies must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditions - Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industry - are all important to understanding his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business, and this, in turn, became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produced (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 105). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl, 1905, p. 142). Examples of this - not specified by Adorno - were the Hollywood production system, or the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 49). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system, and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Pugin 2002). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual (Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an area of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of mass perception ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136).

In his essay on "The Culture Industry," Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Adorno, 2002, p. 101). It was only high art that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culture industry, as opposed to popular culture.

Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Adorno, 2002, p. 101). High art was presented by Adorno as an alternative to the culture industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002).

Adorno criticized pop culture as being a defense of high art, as opposed to a true alternative in his essays on music and radio. He appeared as a defender of high art against the Culture Industry's promotion of pop culture.
