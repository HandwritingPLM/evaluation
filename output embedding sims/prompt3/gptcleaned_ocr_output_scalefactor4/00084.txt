(Barker, 2013), Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system as social conventions or values shared through society. On the contrary, Barthes believes that the actual value lies at the individual level. However, the structure of language is, therefore, a social institution and a system of signifiers. Language is then essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use language with a view to expressing their thoughts, through a code of language, which is a system of arbitrary signs. Language is a system of signs which represents ideas that are mangled through the form.

Focusing on the semiotic development, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts: the signifier and the signified. The signified is a concept of meaning which is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of the language. For example, both the word "dog" in English or in French and the external forms represent the same animal - a dog. The correspondence of the concept is not in the definite relation, but rather in the arbitrary relation. Saussure argues that language does not reflect pre-existing objects but constructs meaning from within itself. Meaning is produced through a process of selecting signs within a paradigmatic set of signs, which are replaced with one another.

Within the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure believes that meaning is generated through relations between signs. The selection of signs within the same paradigm is also guided by linguistic community members. Saussure believes that signs generate meaning through their relation to one another, rather than to any external reality. Meaning is understood as a social convention organized through relations between signs. Saussure's argument is centered on the meaningful relation between signifiers and signified. These differences are organized into a system of meaning through cultural conventions.
