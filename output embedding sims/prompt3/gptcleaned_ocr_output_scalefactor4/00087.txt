Ke expected that communication theories have developed through the lens of psychology since the early 2000s. With errors only stumbled upon by scholars, Llewellyn exploring more varied fields in these disciplines, researchers elected areas of higher concepts of understanding media. A sub-tradition of media effects research, uses and gratifications approach, that suggested to be originally derived from a functional paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory on communication aligns with trends of effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the past, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that the mass media have a direct, immediate, and powerful effect upon audiences by "injecting" information into the minds of the public (Watson & Hill, 1977). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1970s. After that, a shift that conceptualized the relationship between media and people occurred and led to the establishment of uses and gratifications approaches.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media for almost as long a period as communication research is old, 1958). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became interested in the reasons for using different media genres, such as soap operas and quiz shows, and selling old newspaper issues (Berelson & Steiner, 1964). In these studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1973). For instance, reading war reports were found to satisfy the need for knowledge, information, or comfort. For example, escapism was also discovered to provide a sense of security, shared interests in entertainment, and a distraction from the daily grind (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1967) married them with the term gratification.

Needs and gratifications approaches became overwhelming in the late 1950s. This led to a period of the rise of the audience research and gratifications research field. Elihu Katz, an esteemed sociologist and mass communication researcher, received his Ph.D. in psychology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Ohio until his death. Over the past thirty years, Katz shaped the Department of Communication significantly for researchers in the field at Ohio University. Founded in the 1960s by the Government of Israel, he led the task force charged with the introduction of the Public Communication Studies. The experience led to a substantial academic work abroad in broadcasting and telecommunication communications from 197 or 2004. In 1982, he joined the University of the Pennsylvania School of Communication and directed its experimental Scholar Program for sociotechnical research.

Mary Mullen in Ohio witnessed the work of Paul Lazarsfeld, who became one of the pioneers of audience research. That initial work produced a substantial breakthrough that conflated the concepts of gratifications with the functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced ideas of the gratifications approach when he came up with Blumler that people are drawn to their needs in audiovisual media (1974), a subject which is higher at the end of the study of media gratifications. They believed that the media offer a mediated universe that fulfills the needs of select audiences. They have also discussed the function of audiovisuals (Jenner, Carriveau, & Lee, 1974), as well as individuals who are healed, and Katz (1974) perfected as a ceremonious stratification of audience diversity. Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, they published a collection of studies on gratifications in 1974, which outlined The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more interdisciplinary approach to looking at media use. They discussed more nuanced interpretations of media use that differed from previous studies. They also detailed more advanced theories on the function of audiences, (Leesleton, Greenblatt, & Lee, 1974) as healed individuals experiencing satisfaction.
