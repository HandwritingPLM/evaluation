Through the realms of psychology and sociology, media development is well accepted as communication theory continues exploring more untilled fields in these areas. As a sub-tradition of the two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher concepts that originally stemmed from a functional media effects research. The uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be within a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Communication research agrees with media's effects on people. The Hypodermic Syringe model discusses that "the mass media have a direct, immediate, and influential effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses" (Blumler & Katz, 1974). Functional theory influenced studies on communication function, taste establishment, and gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media, dating back to the 1940s (McQuail, 1983). Researchers became interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programs, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well as daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, Herzog, 1944, Warner & Henry, 1948, etc.). In these studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1974). Radio soap operas were found to satisfy listeners with advice, support, or emotional release, while newspapers also provided readers with security, shared topics of conversation, and structure to daily routines (Berelson, 1949). Psychologist Herzog (1944) marked these dimensions of satisfaction with the term "gratifications."

The uses and gratifications approach became prevalent in the late 1950s to 1970s with the growth of television. Basic assumptions of the approach were proposed during that era, with Elihu Katz being one of the key scholars contributing to its establishment.

Elihu Katz served as a sociologist and communication researcher, receiving his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University. He taught at the University of Chicago until 1963, then spent the next thirty years teaching at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in the Department of Sociology and Communication. In the late 1960s, he headed the task force for television broadcasting in Israel, leading to his subsequent academic work on broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication (UPENN, 2001). In 1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania and directed its experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor at Columbia University was Paul Lazarsfeld, a pioneer of gratifications research. Their work together connected the concept of gratifications with the functional theory model. Katz introduced the uses and gratifications approach by suggesting that people use media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), the uses and gratifications research explored how individuals connect or disconnect themselves using the media and manipulate it to benefit them (Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas, 1973).

Blumler, Katz, and others published a collection of essays suggesting that media users seek out the best source to fulfill their needs, providing them with alternate choices to satisfy their needs. They also identified functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission for both society and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
