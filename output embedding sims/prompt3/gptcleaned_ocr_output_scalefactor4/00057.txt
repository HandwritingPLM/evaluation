1. Defining Uncertainty

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson. Berger (2005) states: "these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is aiding in our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct in communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated and the ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 242). The more uncertainty exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to accurately predict behaviors occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only focused on predicting present and past behaviors, but also on predicting what future behaviors they do. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of Uncertainty Reduction Theory captures the complexity of this process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the absence of information that hinders increased verbal and nonverbal behaving, which in turn are expected to increase predictability within interactions. When high uncertainty and predictability can also inhibit aggregation (Afifi, 2000). For instance, Bryant (2000) states: "Too Much certainty can impair the ability to find meaning in an interaction" (p. 305).
