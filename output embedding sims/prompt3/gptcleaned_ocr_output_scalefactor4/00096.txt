In its corps, BartheS was influenced by Saussure's structuralism. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two main key principles: the former is called langue and the latter parole.

While langue is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized,
parole is more flexible because it is the individual expression of language. Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension, emphasizing the collective aspect of langue compared to the individual nature of parole.

Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is the concept or meaning, while the signifier is the external form. These two elements have an arbitrary relation rather than a necessary one, based on differences between signs.

Language constructs meaning internally through a series of conceptual and phonic differences, organized into a signifying system. The selection and combination of signs along syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes form the basis of language structure.

Meaning is understood as a social convention, organized through the relationships between signs. Language operates through cultural conventions and usage, generating meaning through the differences between signs.
