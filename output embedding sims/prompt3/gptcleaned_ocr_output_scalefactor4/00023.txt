1. RETURN TO GERMANY

When published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late '50s, the Institute relocated to Frankfurt and opened in its new premises on 10. Herkheimer became the Vice Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay entitled "How to Look at Television" that was the result of work that had been done for the Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno warned about rigid institutional reforms turning modern mass culture into a mode of widespread psychological control. Up until then, there were few occasions in the 1930s when Adorno addressed the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments of the '60s. Adorno did, however, on occasion, attempt to reshape his thoughts on the culture industry. For example, in 1958 he wrote about universal popular culture in the United States, and gave a video talk in Germany in 1961 on "The Culture Industry Reconsidered." In 1966, when writing the essay "Transparencies on Film," Adorno conceded that filmmaking might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the context of mids (Hohendahl, 1996, p. 11).

2. One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalism, etc., society into a systematic context, as opposed to culture serving ideological ends. For Marcuse, social control mechanisms advanced through culture serving the nation, and the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society. Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive efficiency that kept society subdued and quiescent. The entirety of society had become a network of technology whose main objectives were to maintain social control and could be perpetuated in a way that maintained that control. Also, Adorno wondered whether the informational and entertainment aspects of mass media could be differentiated from the manipulative and indoctrinating functions. However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture or society from the whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or technology as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno had done. In the end, Marcuse's analysis of society presented no opposition to the dominant logic. Marcuse wrote, "How can the people be restored to themselves and know their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce for themselves on an enlarged scale liberate themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? Is there even a think alike that the vicissitudes inch wage to be broken?" Given the pessimistic tone of the book, it is somewhat ironic that large sections of it would be perceived as an icon for leftist movements of the '60s in the US and Germany that developed an oppositional stance. In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher and not an activist. Like others associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be transformed into practice. To review the best book of 1969, Fred Pollack reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that the book required minor revision to be submitted for publication. The two authors persisted, but had difficulties with the Fischer publishing house, which may have only agreed to republish the work since pirate copies had already been distributed by individuals.
