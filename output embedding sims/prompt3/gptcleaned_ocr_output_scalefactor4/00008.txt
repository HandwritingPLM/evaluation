Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational maintenance. This was influenced by the research of scholars like Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the latter part of the 1960s and into the 1970s, cognitive approaches by Hewes, Planalp, Raloff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral aspects of communicative adaptation by Giles, Bungoon, and Paterson. Berger (2005) states: “These early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past two decades” (p. 46). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interactions, or communication as a function of relationship development. Research in interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1960s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the communication field as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research on uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is central to our understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct necessary for the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated and how it has been defined and applied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation where there was a high number of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT). Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from information theorists as well as Heider's research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave” (p. 100). The greater the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions, individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors but also explaining why partners behave or believe the way they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say.” Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can lead to lower levels of communication competence. Incompetent communicators may struggle to develop relationships or may be too anxious to engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) argue that lower levels of uncertainty can lead to increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking. In interactions, individuals are expected to increase predictability with the goal that this will lead to the ability to predict and explain future interactions. When high uncertainty exists, it is often difficult to achieve this goal. Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty and predictability can also hinder a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2014) state: “Too much certainty and predictability can dull a relationship.”
