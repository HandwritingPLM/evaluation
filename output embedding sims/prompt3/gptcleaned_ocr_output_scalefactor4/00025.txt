The members of the Frankfurt School were instrumental in establishing a relationship with the Princeton Radio Research Project, which enabled the Institute to continue working in academia. Adorno, along with Paull Lazarsfeld and other members of the Institute, accepted positions there, despite not knowing what a "radio project" entailed. For his part, Walter Benjamin, in 1942, initiated a correspondence that would ultimately lead to his affiliation with the Institute. Horkeimer had already been working there.
