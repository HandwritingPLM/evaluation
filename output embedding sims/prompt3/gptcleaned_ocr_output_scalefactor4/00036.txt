Newell accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology over the past 10 years. With this, by valuable data as well as exploring more unified fields in these disciplines, researchers elicit a series of right conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-fraction of media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is judged to be originally stemming from a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory does not agree with media's effects on people. For example, a model observed in the Hypodermic Needle theory discusses that mass media has a direct, immediate, and influential effect upon audiences by injecting information into the consciousness of the masses (Watson, Hill, & Shoham, 1983, p. 105). Functional theory influenced studies of communication from the 1950s to the 1970s, after which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to the establishment of uses and gratifications approach. 

The exploration of gratifications showed that media people to be attracted to particular messages and affect an odd empirical mass communication research (McQuail, 1993). Dating back to the 1950s, researchers became interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programs, such as soap operas and quiz shows and even daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1940; Herzog, 1944; Lasswell & Berelson, 1949, etc.). In these studies, researchers discovered that the fulfillment of certain needs can either by done by specific content or by the medium itself (Maibach et al., 1974). For instance, soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with emotional relief (Herzog, 1944; Warren and Carey, 2009), while the news, newspapers, and ads discovered to be important to give audiences a sense of belonging, a topic for conversations and a structure to the day routine (Berseson, 1945). For these diverse diversions of usage satisfaction, psychologists play a significant role in the term "productive- perception."

Uses and gratifications approach became revived beginning in the late 1940s but it's height of the approach era originated when it was rediscovered during the end. Among the group of scholars who focused on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz was one of the most well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the realm of the approaches.

Elihu Katz started out as an excited young researcher. He graduated Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1959. Over the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communications at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1980s, aided by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting. The experience led to subsequent scholarly work in broadcasting and television industries, culture, and communication figures.

By 2002, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School and Penn's Center for Media and Public Affairs. He also co-directed a public scholars program for professional communication strategists, mentoring in Columbia University's Paul Lazarsfeld for the pioneers of communications research. Their creativity and teamwork fostered important growth that underscored the effects of public satisfaction and functional theory. Katz and his associated then advanced the remaining assessment of public responses by creating influential cohort partners that supported each program regarding individual constructs of discourses and required that programs redesigned proves more readily than their media opponents (Katz, Gurevitch, & Haas, 1973).

Amongst collaborations with his loyal ally, Roger Obisercher, they increased appreciativeness by backing off Freud in the exploration that the works of Mann could serve as a fresh basis. Thus, they insisted that readers would seek cues and social connections within Mann's work that individual volition to sway the behavior of readers. For an accessible and individual user, they investigated entertainment and journalistic fulfillments for an engaging correlation, satisfaction, entertainment, and cultural freshness for an existing researcher (Katz & Gurevitch, 1973).
