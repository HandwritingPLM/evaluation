To prepare! Structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics by speaking of several sperales on two levels, the systematic system and the variation colors. The former is called "langue" and the latter is a set of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material contained in it. Opposed to it, speech ("parole") covers the purely individual part of language for Barthes.

Barthes sees Saussure's linguistic system within the social context: social conventions of value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. Parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level, however, it is considered relatively inflexible due to the fact that speech, created by an individual, cannot be free from the system of values that make up language. Language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social aspect of language, essentially a collective contract that one must accept in its entirety in order to communicate. Language resists modifications from a single individual due to the collective values it embodies. In contrast, speech is an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the language code to express personal thoughts.

Barthes (1967) describes speech as a combinative activity that corresponds to an individual act and not a pure creation. Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is the concept or meaning expressed through the form, called the signifier. The correspondence of concept/meaning to the external form is in the arbitrary relation, not a destined one. Saussure argues that language constructs meaning from within itself through differences, not reflecting a pre-existent reality. Language produces meaning through a series of signs along two axes, syntagmatic and paradigmatic.

Through the syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes, signs do not make sense by reference to entities in the world but are related to each other. Meaning is understood as a social convention and is meaningful in relation to the differences of their usage within a particular context.
