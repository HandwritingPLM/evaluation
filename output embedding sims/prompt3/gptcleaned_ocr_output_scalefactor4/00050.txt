Needs and Gratifications

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch. They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between audience needs and media use:

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of mass media use is assumed to be goal-oriented. Patterns of media use are shaped by more or less conscious evaluations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience.

2. In the mass communication process, much initiative is taken by the audience member in linking need gratification with media choice. This places a limit on theorizing about any sort of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the degree to which they can be adequately met through media consumption certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - people are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their terms (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous research on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people to the media, they did not address the connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifications research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2) needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) differential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Katz et al., 1974b, p. 20). The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and gratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in an electronic information age when people have more options for media use.

1. Needs and Gratifications

Researchers have found that perceptions of audience members' motives and self-perceived needs differ. Each emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. It is concluded that different people can use the same communication message for different gratifications.

Uses and gratifications are not one-size-fits-all. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that certain media appeals; there are as many ways as there are media users (Blumer & Katz, 1974).

Each situation and individual's context influence what they want from media and what needs they seek to fulfill. People are aware and can state their own motives and preferences regarding media consumption. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interaction" to classify four important media gratifications.
