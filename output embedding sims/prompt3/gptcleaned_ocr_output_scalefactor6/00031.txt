TAPES AND GRAMMAR 
Needs and Gratifications

Lee and Getz (1974) approached empirical audienc research with a bottom-up methodology that assumed audience members:
park Bomber and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication media for very different purposes. The same media content may provide different sources of gratification for different individuals. There is not a one map to media use. On the contrary, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and an individual's background, such as occupation, income, and education, shape people's expectations of what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their motivations and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or stress; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-enhancement; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience motivation matrix was suggested by Mosher (1974) based on a perception theory of human needs. He distinguished between basic needs and affective needs. Then he added three dimensions: "active ventures," "perception maintenance," and "emotional stability" or "growth" and "preservation." When combined, these dimensions yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1. Figure 1 shows an array of 16 perceptual paradigms of human motivation (Mosher, 1974). Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee (1974) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the Mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;

2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feeling;

3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility of alternative sources;

4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with others and friends;

5. Tension release needs, including escape from the tensions of daily life.
