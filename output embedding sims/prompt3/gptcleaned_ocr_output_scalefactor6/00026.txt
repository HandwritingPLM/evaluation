Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

One major focus in the search for explaining the great appeal of the core question of such research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1983). There exists a basic idea in this approach that media content serves as a means which individuals can use to meet their needs. Contrary to the traditional communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of linking need gratification and media choice squarely in the hands of audience members. It suggests that peopleâ€™s needs influence what media they would choose, how they use certain media, and what gratifications the media provide them. This approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active participants opposed to passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus on "what media do to people" and assume audiences are homogeneous, uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). It takes into account audiences' personal needs in using media and how they respond to the media, which is determined by their social and psychological backgrounds. Uses and gratifications approach also points out that the media competes with other information sources for audience's highest satisfaction (Katz et al., 1974a). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different media. The approach emphasizes audiences' choices by assessing their reasons for using certain media to the exclusion of others, as well as the various gratifications they receive from the media based on their individual social and psychological requirements (Severin & Tankard, 1997). As a broader perspective among media theories, it provides a framework for understanding the processes by which audiences consume content effectively. This can create a better rapport, and total, 1974). Audience members then incorporate their abilities to satisfy their interests (Lowery & Nabi, 2012).

1.2 Origin and History
Theories have developed through the years. With documented valuable ideas as well as its well-accepted that communication has roots in areas of psychology and sociology over the past three decades, exploring more unified fields in these two major components of understanding media disciplines, researchers have.
