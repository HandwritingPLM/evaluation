1. Needs and Gratifications

Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the well-perceived remedial audience mem-
ber. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes-
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may have different needs for different 
individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Conversely, there are as many reasons 
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and their individual's background, such as experience, influences, and
education, affect people's choices about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their motivations and gratifications
for using media. Blumler and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person interaction” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional pleasure; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social integration; (4) Personal identity: self-reinforcement; symbolic capabilities; value reinforcement; and (21 Surveillance [forms of information-seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivations is suggested by McQuail (1974), based
on a Person Theory of human needs. He distinguished between two kinds of need: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” media, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When combined,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1
presents 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McQuail, 1974). Katz, Gunzberg, and Haas
(1974) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the media and
put them into four categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding.
2. Affective needs, including cognition, pleasure, feelings.
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility of subjective states.
4. Social (interpretive) needs, including integrating within groups and friendships; and
5. Tension release needs, including escapism and diversion.

Consequently, McLuhan’s (1964) classification of the telic media environment may be
viewed as:

- Finding out about relevant news and common experience in widespread surroundings, preferably in the world
- Addressing issues of practical importance or opinion and decision choices
- Satisfying curiosity and general interest

- Providing a sense of security through nervous helping

- Aiding in the building of human relations
- Finding models of behavior
- Identifying with valued themes in the media
- Gaining insight into oneself.
