1 Ones Propaganda Theedion

O Barovell Ltr 102-0 ED:

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself.

Harold Lasswell (200-17) was a prominent figure in the world of propaganda, advocating the sheer relevance and qualities of propaganda, underscoring the context of propaganda, its importance, and the power it possesses. He argued that the potential of propaganda could be understood in accordance with the frequency with which it is perceived, read, and discussed. Propaganda serves as a means of engaging and impacting individuals on a more profound level.

Different terminologies and meanings are often manipulated in order to serve specific purposes, which are deliberately concealed and presented in a strategic manner. People may believe or be influenced by what they see, read or hear without fully comprehending or evaluating the intended message.

By analyzing the psychological subtleties and linguistic manipulations used in propaganda, individuals can better understand the subtle strategies employed, which may be disguised within the text or context of the communication.
