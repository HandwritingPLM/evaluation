1 Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

The 1872 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the Culture Industry outside of a German context. In the years that were to follow, Igan Feists began to raise criticisms of the text, ales accusing Adorno of developing generalizations about the greater need for commodification of all cultural goods" (Genk, 2006, p. 13). For the generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the practices of cultural production, and failed to examine the cultural industry's economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1964, p. 4).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, holding the view that "capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification" (Eagleton, 1981, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that "the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs among oppressed peoples in society has a part to play in the reproduction of the system as a whole" (Eagleton, 1994, p. 9). Fredric Jameson points out that Adorno's analysis of the culture industry was historically limited, since the society that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s with new media surpassed the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s. While the idea of the culture industry may be defensible as a useful theory for industrial society between 1920 and 1970, attempting to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 14648). Thus, for some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry appears to be merely theoretical as they do not concede that it had any value at all.

The fear that some commercial works would be excluded from critical analysis of the culture industry seems unfounded. It would seem that scare more than anything else. The idea of the culture industry has had an important place in critical analysis, as Adorno and Horkheimer theorized about the role of mass communications in shaping ideologies and in shaping generalizations about the impact of free culture among the public. However, it did not systematically explore how the culture industry operates. While the need to cherish the idea of a culture industry as a place where our cultural products are all made by the consumerist companies, it is also worth noting that new forms and new ideas about how authors operate. As we progress further into the age of digital media and democratizing aspects to the Internet, the commercial companies operating across the globe will only increasingly influence our cultural norms and practices.

For example, the success of a search engine as big as Google serves as an example of a second group of corporate America that is rapidly expanding. It is understandable then that various commercial activities are heavily intertwined with their investments offering democratizing aspects to the Internet.
