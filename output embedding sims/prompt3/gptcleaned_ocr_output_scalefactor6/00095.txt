Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1 Harold Lasswell (1907-1975)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda.

In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 1994).

1.2 Harold Lasswell (1900-1978) was a key figure in the area of propaganda research. He focused on understanding the elements of propaganda. Lasswell believed that propaganda plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion.

Lasswell can be credited with creating a model that helps in analyzing the impact of propaganda on the audience (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be defined as the investigation of communication messages by categorizing various elements.

Lasswell's analysis focuses on understanding the direction in which symbols are used. By understanding the symbols, one can grasp the goal of understanding the flow of influence that occurs from content to content and from content to audience.

This early form of content analysis is rigorous and detailed. It examines what is communicated through which channels and how individuals respond. Lasswell's seminal work within this field aimed at understanding the role of communication in shaping public opinion.

During the war, Lasswell developed a model where the public is constrained in the information presented to them and cautious in accepting it. However, it is essential to note the limitations of this model when applied in a complex and rapidly evolving media landscape.
