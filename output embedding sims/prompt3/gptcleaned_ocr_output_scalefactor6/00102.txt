Needs and Gratifications

The Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Bueler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may have different effects for different individuals. There are also many reasons for using the media. There are also media users (Blumer & Katz, 1971).

Basic needs, social evaluation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and evaluation, influence people's desires about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their core motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Sumer, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interaction" to classify four important media gratifications: [1] Diversions-escape from routine or problems; emotional release; [2] Personal relationships-companionship; sociability; [2] Personal identity-self-reference; self-esteem; value reinforcement; and [2] Surveillance-forms of information seeking.

Another subdivision and clarification of the audience's motivations was suggested by Parkins (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between 2 types of needs: Cognitive and affective. Then he attached 3 determinants: "external" goal orientation, “activities, and emotions stability of practice” and “preservation. When charted, these factors yield 16 different basic motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). A further ranking of 14 specific conditions of human motivation (McQuail, 1978). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, and escape;
3. Personal integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends;
4. Social integrative needs, namely interacting with family and friends;
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Furthermore, McQuail's (198) classification of the following core reasons for media use:

- Finding out about more remote areas and conditions
- Handling immediate surroundings, policy, and the world
- Seeking advice on personal matters or opinions and deciding on them
- Hearing self-education
- Gaining a sense of security concerning broken or threatened ties
- Establishing control over one's environment for personal goals
- Feeding models of behaviors
- Relating with like-minded others in the region
- Gaining insights into one's self
