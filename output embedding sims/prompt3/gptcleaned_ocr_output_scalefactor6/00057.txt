Defining Uncertainty

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hoyland. By the 1950s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of scholars like Knapp, Metz, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade and into the 1960s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson. Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the nature of relationships. It has been

Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major stepping five on the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work

Defining Uncertainty

Since Uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of Information Theory.

Shannon and Weaver related this version of uncertainty to the amount of information that contributed to the development of ICT, Berger and 5.

information theories as well as how Hitchcock's (1958) research in attribution, Easterbrook (1958) pinpointed the concept of uncertainty to the interpersonal relationships (1975).

Furthermore, Berger's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted that uncertainty arises from the lack of information, and it can stem from a variety of things.

High levels of uncertainty can lead to increased verbal and nonverbal behaviors in initial interactions. These behaviors may be expressed in more than.
