Methodologically speaking, many of the ways of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le, peuple

suspended while audience demands are explored on their own merits, (9. L317.

In addition, Katz, Schomer, and Gurevitch have commented that, although previous researches on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people of the media, they did not address the
connections barwoon these feedcompilations (Katz et al, 19744). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
cations: research concerns with following aspects: (1) Us social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the more media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly experienced ames” (Katz et al, 1974b, p20) The studies of Boyer and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended The careful slice of uses and
gratificagor is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in
such an electronic information age when people have more options of xvi uss.
