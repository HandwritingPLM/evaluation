Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the public, and the perception of attention-generating propaganda is inclining Public opinion (Barrow, 1988, p. 8). Bernays (1928) makes a statement regarding his principles, the engineering of consent He said, Engineering opinion planning. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-tare: it is more about strategic planning than noise publicity and propaganda (Barrow, 1988, p. 22). Further, Bernays' theories also present a different view of the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who saw the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, "The public is not an amorphous mass with ears but molded at will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p. 68). Indeed, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in attempting to influence the public, a business must consider what terms the partnership can be made amicable and potentially beneficial. It must sell the aims, the perspectives, to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 5).

Beneath elaborate on this: Mass in Public relations (PR), Boats Bee sees manipulation of the public through openness. Bernays positions public relations as an essential tool in navigating the contemporary situation, or helps the public adapt to it (1945, p. 4). Bernays's view of the public is different than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of influence but still claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the perspectives of others, to exercise leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts being made by others, and to recommend courses of action" (p. 8). Under this framework, while the public is still prominent, it is not so much naive ignorance of the public pinks. The greater much like Lippmann and Ellul divided on this part.
