A language is therefore a system of communication and a system of values that the English can effect. Thus it is really a collective contract which one must aim at unifying in a society of mores. Within a community, a language is a set of conventional signs that individuals borrow for spoken communication and for private thought. Each speaking subject can use the language with the aim of expressing personal ideas as his own speech involves the combinations actively regulating once they are already determined. English has developed based on the linguistic differences of English and Korean which are similar yet different in how they are used. Both are language forms of communication. The word 'sign' signifies the concept of signifier that is separate from the concept of meaning and suggests a fundamental division between their two elements and their compound sign. This analogy systematically reflects the fundamental distinction and the mutual independence of their meaning with various subtle differences. Therefore, the semantic meaning is created through a process of selecting and combining various elements. The paradigmatic organization of individual elements conveys a significant pattern and is guided by the language's structural principles. The significance of the meaning is within the overall idea, and the relationship between the signs is involved in the operation of the signifying structure. The overall and unifying principle is maintained by the governing principle of their interaction with the analogies formed during the evaluation process. The structured associations influence the languages within the paradigm so that they may be subject to the similarities present there. Ultimately, this forms the basis for the creation and dissemination of meanings within the language.
