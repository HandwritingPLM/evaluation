In late fall, the leaves will be turning gold and red, and they will be fluttering down to carpet the ground. The squirrels will be scurrying around, burying nuts ; the crows will be cawing, their harsh calls ringing out from the treetops. It will be a beautiful and peaceful time of year.

The air will be crisp and cool, and the sun will be shining brightly in the clear blue sky. The smell of wood smoke will drift through the air, mingling with the earthy scents of fallen leaves and damp earth. It will be a perfect day for a hike through the woods, or a leisurely stroll through the park.

As the afternoon wears on, the sky will begin to darken and the first stars will appear. The moon will rise, casting a silvery light over the landscape. The crickets will start to chirp, their cheerful melodies filling the air. It will be a magical, peaceful night, filled with the sounds of nature.

J. Stevens Redwood, in his book, "A Year in the Woods," describes autumn in the forest with great eloquence and detail. He writes about the changing colors of the leaves, the animals preparing for winter, and the sense of tranquility that descends on the forest. It is a beautiful and evocative picture of the season.

In conclusion, autumn is a time of great beauty and peace. It is a season to be cherished and enjoyed, a time to savor the sights, sounds, and smells of nature. So go outside, take a deep breath, and let the magic of autumn envelop you.
