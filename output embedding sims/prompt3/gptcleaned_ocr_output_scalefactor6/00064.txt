Return to Germany

was published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested this was
done without their own consent in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the end,
the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rapid industrialization transforms media culture into a medium of undreamed
of psychological control (Adorno, 1954, p. 3). He was one of the few academics in the 1950s
that Adorno was interested in the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of the day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jaeger, 1960, p. 101). Adorno would sometimes undergo attempts to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1959, p. 20), and gave a public talk in Germany in 1966 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1956, when revisiting the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that filmmaking might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the orbit of academia (Heberle, 1956, p. 81).

Mainly for an analysis of late capitalist society in a systematically consistent, as opposed to
other writings at the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 65). Instead of cultivating
ecological ethics, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society was
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Felluga, 2011, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it created a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society stupefied and quiescent (Arendt, 1959, p. 57). The
totality of society had become organized around an ideology where mass objectives were in
fulfillment and social control and manipulation. Admitting Adorno, Marcuse pondered whether
the needs of mass man could be distinguished from their manipulation and indoctrination (Marcuse, 1964, p. 8). Moreover, it is difficult to balance arguments separating matters
of fading freedom from servility as a whole because Marcuse does not distinguish cultural
and personal marks as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way
that Adorno had attempted. The unique circumstances of postwar Germany that developed an oppositional stance,
and Magie, Marcuse recognized that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like poor
