Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories.

The themes developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Gehrer, and Bernays are important for our understanding of public relations. Based on the ideas of their predecessors, Casement and Greig, attention to the fact that their work is one of the chief influences on the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has been pivotal in research efforts to help understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the work of Gehrer and Kinder, Tite, Gluer, and Motes of Shaw, a clearer understanding of the winds has been developed. The research now demands more nuanced analyses and functions such as speed-typing, editing, and their potential effects on the public. 

The theories presented in this paper are closely tied to discerning the direct effects and combined efforts resulting in success. These actions are decided to take place beside each other, directly influencing the thoughts of individuals. Indeed, theorists such as Lippmann emphasized that the message could not only be influencing a thought but also shaping how people think about it. It was this line of thinking that inspired and propelled further research into the realm of the indirect effects of the media. Such studies were evident through the work of Lasswell and Kinder, as well as Motes and Shaw. Overall, the research discussed in this paper has been very important for the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public, and the doctrine of public opinion. While the works of Lasswell, Lippmann, and Ellul were formed in the past, they continue to be vital in our contemporary society.
