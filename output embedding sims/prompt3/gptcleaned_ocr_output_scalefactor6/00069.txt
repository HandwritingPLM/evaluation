1 Needs and Gratifications

USES and applications approaches emphasize meeting and the perceived needs of audience members.
Jay Blumler and Elihu Katz concluded that different people consume the same communication content
for very different purposes. The mass media can serve many different needs for different

Individuals. There is only one way that people use media. Conversely, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic attitudes, values, situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. Thus, audience members are aware of and can state their desires and gratifications
for using different media. Blumler and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person
interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; sociability; (3) Personal
Identity: self-realization; reality exploration; self-reinforces; and (4) Surveillance [source of interest]:
sense of integration.

As Leonard Rubenstein in "The Audience's Imagination" states, in 1978, based on a general theory of human needs, he distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “outward” versus “inward” orientation, “external” versus
“internal goal orientation, and emotional stability of “proudness and “pleasure.” When combined,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use [Figure 1]. A
Schematics of 16 general gratifications is illustrated by this theory. Mitsui [1984], for
instance, Gunewitch and Maer [1979] developed 35 needs taken from the psychological and social
functions of the mass media and put them into four categories:

1 Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;

2 Aesthetic needs, including stimulation, pleasure, feelings;

3 Personal integration needs, including stability, status; roles;

4 Social integration needs, including interacting with family and
friends, etc.
