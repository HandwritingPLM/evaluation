1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of masking, dissonance, bal-
ance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2006). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology,
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Hodges,
Kelly, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars
as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade
and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Heider, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Bergman, and Peterson.
Berger (2006) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research
agenda during the past few decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on that dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication
affecting the development, maintenance of relationships. Research in interpersonal communication typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is moderated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, para.
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
on the theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is central in our
understanding of interpersonal processes.

1. Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important concept in the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated and how it has been defined and understood. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of uncertainty reduction theory. Shannon and Weaver proposed that uncertainty related to the generation of noise in communication (NEE

Many contributed to the development of uncertainty as well. Berger and Colleague (1958) researched
the concept of uncertainty in interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
in which each interaction might be" (p. 46). The question is whether one
