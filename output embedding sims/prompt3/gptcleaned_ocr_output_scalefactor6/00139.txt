Jumping through the realms of psychology and sociology, it is well accepted that communication has been of great significance for more than the last 100 years. Buoyed by valuable insights and a direct of higher conceptions of understanding and perspectives; media effects research, uses and gratifications approach has been suggested to be originally emanated from formalist paradigm in the social sciences (Barker & Katz, 1974). To some extent, it is the perception of communication agents with media's effects towards people, for example, a case in point is the Hypodermic Syringe Model, discussing that "the mass media have a direct, immediate effect upon audiences by 'injecting' information into the consciousness of the masses" (Barker & Katz, 1974).

After that, a shift influenced studies on communication from the 1950s to the 1970s, featuring the uses and gratifications approach emerging. The exploration of motivations that drive people to be attracted to different media goes back to the 1940s, researchers became interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programs, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well as daily newspapers (Lasswell & Stanton, 1945; Hovland, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.). In these studies, researchers discovered a host of functions served either by specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1946), for instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice, support, or occasions for emotional release (Hovland, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); whereas newspapers were discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1959). Given their diverse dimensions of use satisfaction, psychological welfare (1944) marked them with the term "predispositions".

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s when television has grown up. Some basic assumptions of this approach were propagated when it was rediscovered during that era. Among the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz was one of the most well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is considered both an esteemed educator and a pioneer, He earned his Ph.D. in Psychology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1969. During the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, In 1969 invited by the Government of Israel, He became the Task force charged with The introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about broadcasting and television in general, culture and communication from the 1970s to 2000s (UPENN, 2007). In 1982, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its Experimental Scholar. pacer for peace sector Studies.

Another key figure in Communication Studies is Paul Lazarsfeld, Who was one of the pioneers of gratifications research. Their collaborative work produced important findings that connected the concept of gratifications with the Functional theory of the media. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratifications theory whereby he came up with the notion that people use the media to their benefit, this is supported by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), a subject which is known as uses and gratifications research was developed. They witnessed the mass media as the means by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people hold the media to fulfill their needs. They made a more precise dig in 1984 where they have validated choices in acting as they wish (Altheide & Gump, 1974). They also identified the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and individual participation (Entman and Katz, 1974), entertainment and cultural transmission for both society.
