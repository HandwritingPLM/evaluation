Uses and Gratifications

1. Introduction

The uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original conception of the approach was based on the search for explaining the general appeal of certain media contents. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? The basic idea in this approach is that audience members choose media content, and which media meet a need in the mass communication process. Uses and gratifications approach puts the focus of linking needs and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. Successive research reveals how media they consume, how they use certain media and what gratifications the media gives them. The approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to mere receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus on what media do to people and assume audiences are passive recipients, the Uses and Gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). It allows for personal needs in using media and considers the role media play, which determines by psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also assesses how traditional mass media and new media compete with other information sources for the audience's attention and how audiences continue to grow in content, making it one of the most appropriate.
