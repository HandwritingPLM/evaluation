So I managed by Dr. Mary Sands of CRAA Consultancy to speak with Victor Ortega who is the general manager of the hotel as well as two of his employees about the problems faced by the hotel. They indicated magnitudes of problems particularly regarding the uncomfortable work environment caused by loud and aggressive behaviors of some staff members. Although Victor Ortega was aware of these issues, he failed to address them effectively. The employees were also hesitant to directly confront their colleagues due to fears of backlash. The situation has resulted in decreased productivity and increased turnover rates, reflecting the urgent need for intervention. I plan to conduct a more thorough analysis of the situation to provide appropriate recommendations to address these issues effectively and promote a healthier work environment for the hotel staff.
