Foggers was born in Caroll, Iowa in 1931. He earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, In 1968, he worked on some military planning and communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and its application in various fields such as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 1985 because he was suffering from kidney disease. He died on December 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1995), diffusion refers to the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation can be an idea or practice perceived as new by an individual or group for adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels. Rogers (1995) mentioned, "this 5-Mil-R-E model corresponds closely to the elements of GAS." Specifically, (1) senders can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) messages can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and ultimately (5) the effect can be adoption or rejection of the change. In this diffusion theory, "Time" is an important factor. According to Rogers (1992), the key variables in diffusion are (1) the adoption decision process, (2) innovativeness, (3) an innovation's rate of adoption. Once in an S-shaped curve of adoption, there are barriers to the rate of diffusion that influence how quickly an idea or innovation is adopted or rejected through media, such as interpersonal communication or innovation channels.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to literature sources: (1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (deliberate), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional) (Rogers, 1995, pp. 163-185). Rogers defined this term as the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adapting new ideas than other members of his social system (Rogers, 1995, p. 400). Figure 1 shows the relationship between types of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped.

However, as noted above, different types of innovations (e.g., the rate of tetracycline adoption is faster than that of the hybrid corn) can have their own different rates of diffusion. Figure 2.
