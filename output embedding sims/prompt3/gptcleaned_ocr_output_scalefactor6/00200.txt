GENESIS OF "THE CULTURE INDUSTRY"

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception, these are examined chronologically. There are pre-conditions, theories, and its subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry arose out of a crisis within culture, it developed through insights into the mechanical reproduction of culture, and is ultimately positioned in opposition not only to popular aesthetics, but also to modern art. All of this has significant implications.

The concept was first explored by Walter Benjamin in 1933, along with his two colleagues Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer. Adorno, in particular, became Benjamin's primary student. After Benjamin's death, Adorno continued the work of both developing and critiquing a shared version of their ideas. This relationship with Benjamin significantly influenced Adorno's thoughts during his time in Frankfurt.

Adorno lost his teaching position in Berlin due to the rise of the Nazi party, prompting him to establish a branch of the Institute in Geneva. From there, the direction of the Institute shifted not only away from traditional studies, but also affected philosophical thought. Jurgen Habermas later noted the impact of Adorno's work within critical theory, alongside Stalinist repression and the commodification of mass culture in the United States.

Adorno's arguments are evident in his critical engagement with consumer culture. Benjamin and Adorno debated the role of culture, ultimately resulting in an intellectual split between them. The debate also highlighted the ongoing struggle against fascist ideologies. Adorno's work reflected the challenges of separating art from politics in the contemporary era.

Adorno's goal was to liberate art from hierarchical structures and transform society. He claimed that his colleague, Max Horkheimer, never truly understood what a "free project" meant. Despite their differing views, Adorno continued to work towards societal change, both independently and in collaboration with others. His work in this field continued to be influential among scholars and activists alike.
