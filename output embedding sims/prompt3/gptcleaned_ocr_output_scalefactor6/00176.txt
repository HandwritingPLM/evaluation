Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which composes it - as opposed to it, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 1988).

Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure itself, langue, is the social convention or value shared within a society, which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure is language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, and it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. This is because language is a system of contractual values that resists modifications coming from single individuals and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thoughts. This is because speech is a combinative activity that corresponds to an individual act and not to pure creation (Barthes, 1967).

Focusing on the systematic flow, Saussure distinguishes the language system into four parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through a form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word "dog" in English or in Kannan are the external forms for expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "I propose to retain the word sign (signe) to designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signne) and signifier (signifiant). The last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1952).

The correspondence of the concept meaning to the external form is not in the chosen form, but rather in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation, but the difference between the sign that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1860) argued that language does not reflect an efficient and external reality of independent objects. But connects meaning far within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences. According to Saussure, "meaning is added through a process of selection and combination of signs along the syntagmatic (e.g., a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system" (Barthes, 2002).

As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigms are a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities of selecting the signs within the same paradigm, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, let's consider the following message: "I went to a restaurant with my girlfriend." The sign within the sample, such as "Uriah, fry, and gore can be substituted by other signs in the paradigm, such as "She went to a bar last night." Through the syntagmatic and the paradigms, we see that signs are operated on when they are related to each other. Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of reference to an independent object outside; rather, they perform meaning by reference to each other. Thus, meaning is determined and does not come from an external reality (Saussure, 1952).

Saussure's argument is that every sign has a part to play in the greater structure, and these signs are then combined into a discourse that generates meaning. Through the cultural conventions of their usage, these signs acquire a general meaning throughout the cultural system (Barthes, 1988).
