OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

Other Propaganda Theorists

Gerald Lasswell (1892-1978) was a pioneer in undertaking empirical studies of propaganda. One of the key findings was that much of the propaganda he analyzed was actually written by Lippmann himself.

Rogers, 1994, argues that while Lasswell is credited with developing core concepts, the content itself can be misleading. Many scholars, including Goering and Cohen, have criticized Lasswell's work for lacking a solid theoretical framework. In his essay "The Control of Communication," Lasswell emphasizes the importance of understanding the context of the message. He aims to trace the flow of influence from content to audience, and his work has been associated with the concept of selective perception.

In examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion, Edward Bernays (1891-1995) defined propaganda as a persistent, persuasive attempt to shape events and influence the behavior of individuals, groups, or nations. His work explores the ethical implications of propaganda, questioning whether it ultimately serves the public good or is harmful. Bernays emphasizes the role of perception and belief in shaping public opinion and suggests that propaganda can be both beneficial and harmful.

Bernays also delves into the role of persuasion in shaping public opinion, arguing that effective public relations campaigns require a deep understanding of human psychology and communication. He asserts that the key to a successful public relations campaign lies in appealing to the values and virtues of society and ultimately influencing public opinion in the desired direction.

Based on these observations, Bernays suggests that the use of propaganda is an essential part of modern society and plays a crucial role in shaping public perception and opinion. In the context of today's highly mediated world, Bernays' insights continue to be relevant, offering a valuable perspective on how propaganda and persuasion operate in contemporary society.
