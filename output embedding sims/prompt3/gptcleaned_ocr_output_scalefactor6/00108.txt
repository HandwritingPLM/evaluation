Like many other semiotician scholars, Derrida was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. To Saussure, they distinguish mechanisms of ideas on what are characteristic rather than referential: By appealing to that which is called linguistics and the latter parole, Language is seen as a system of signifiers necessary to communication, inherently linked to the material of the sign which composes. It is opposed to speech (considered in other words the purely individual aspect of language) (Saussure, 1957, p. 13). Scholars interpret Saussure's linguistic theories with a social orientation. The structure allows the study of language, even at a glance at gesture or body language, to be a matter of attraction and deciphering. On the other hand, parole becomes less because it is the actual expression of the individual. However,

As communication itself is a shared contribution, the interaction of language is therefore a social construction and a reservoir of values. It is a communicative contest which can be found in every part of a color or music sheet, in theater or cinema screen. Here, the external reality is enclosed in the word or meaning which is expressed through the tongue. The formula is then a sea of echo, a mere semantic sea of language. For example, behind a word spoken or read in English or another language a symbolic representation, a property in itself is manifested. This designated whole replaces concepts and sound-image pieces. By showing, the last link comes here where each word has a distinctive power that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are derived" (Saussure, 1999). The comprehensibility of concepts leading to the general notion of what is central in the continued circulation, but instead, in the interconnections of concepts that follow the appearance of The signs that distinguish the signifying system. Saussure (1916) argues that language does not reflect a precedent and autonomous reality independent of the speaker. It constructs itself from within itself through a series of conceptual and phasic differences. According to Saussure, "meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs, which can be understood as a syntagmatic (for example, scientific) and the paradigmatic (for example, allegorical, conventionalized symbolic order)" (Harker, 2002, p. 23). A given grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the paradigmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Cultural variables in selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, the selection is also dictated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, let's consider the following sentence: "I went to a concert with my friend." The event here is the rare combination of signs. The friend in this example, such as the concert, my, and friend can be replaced by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She went to a restaurant with her roommate." Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs have meaning only when they are related to each other. Crucially, signs do not make clear the world of an independent object; rather, they generate meaning by referring to each other. Thus, meaning is understood as a social convention organized through the relationships between signs (Saussure, 2002, pp. 21-22). It can be concluded from Saussure's argument that red is meaningful in relation to the differences between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are thus categorized in a multitude of ways through their differences.
