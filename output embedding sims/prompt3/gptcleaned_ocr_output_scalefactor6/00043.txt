i. EARLY INFLUENCES

If [f Core nce,
Therefore uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.
The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle for individual uncertainty.

1. Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication:

The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.10 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the leaders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduating, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1942, he followed Lewin to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Sanchez, 2008). Much of Festinger's research followed the work of Lewin and further developed his theories, which were highly influential in the field of interpersonal communication and in the development of Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT).

Lewin's theories, along with Festinger's Cognitive Dissonance Theory, attempted to explain how imbalances among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT in his original Gestalt theory. CDT argues that individuals seek to reduce tension by realigning their dissonant cognitions through various means. Social comparison theory postulates that individuals seek feedback from others to validate their own beliefs and abilities.

Cognitive dissonance theory and LRT both suggest that individuals seek to align their perceptions with their actions. By starting to realign their perceptions, they work towards a higher level of consistency, rewarding the appropriate behaviors. Festinger received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's legacy and theoretical influence can still be recognized in modern social science research. As Festinger (1980) stated, "It was in this era that Leo Festinger invested much time and energy in the development of his theory."

In conclusion, social psychology has not been the same since Festinger's profound contributions. Festinger's legacy lives on in contemporary social science research. Festinger, along with Heider (1958) and Berger and Calabrese (1975), paved the way for understanding communication theories and research.

2. Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider was a pioneer in the field of social cognition. Heider's Attribution Theory, Schadenfreude Theory, and Balance Theory have had lasting impacts on the field of social psychology. Heider's work emphasized the importance of how individuals perceive and explain the behavior of others, contributing significantly to the understanding of social interactions.

Heider's research focused on interpersonal perception, social inference, and attribution processes. Heider's work has influenced subsequent research on social judgment and decision-making. His work remains relevant in contemporary social psychology and continues to shape our understanding of social interactions and relationships.
