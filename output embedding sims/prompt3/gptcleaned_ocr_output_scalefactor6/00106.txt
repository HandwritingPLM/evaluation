1. Critical Response to "The Culture Industry"

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since, there have been numerous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about "the commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 173). For the generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1995, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, believing that "capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification" (Eagleton, 1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that "the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs among oppressed parties in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the system as a whole" (Eagleton, 1991, p. 75). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno's idea

while the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful concept, especially between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 146-48).

He complained to the dean about the radical students in his classes who were making

teaching impossible. In the winter term of 1968-69, students occupied a number of buildings

at the University at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research. After the strike

ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, including
