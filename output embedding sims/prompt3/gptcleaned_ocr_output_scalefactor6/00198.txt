i. Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasized both an ration eel and Berger and ¬ Katz (1975) concluded that different people have different needs when it comes to consuming media content. The same media content may serve different purposes for different people and individuals. This is one way of perceiving the media as there are media users' social di-course and the individual's background, such as socio-economic strata and cultural background, influence people’s expectations about what they want from media which media can reach. That is, audience members are aware of and cater to their state should as much as possible using different preceding patterns. Blummer and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “spectator interactions” to capacity four important media gratifications: (1) Diversions or escape from routine everyday problems; (2) Personal relationships, companionship, social welfare, play; (3) Personal identity, self-reference; reality escape equal value substitutes; and (4) Surveillance, Sharper of Research [Rogers or Ser rncorc {1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: complementary and deficiency needs. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “internal” versus “external” goal orientation, and cognitive stability or variability of “gain” and “preservation”. When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 2 shows a structuring of two paradigms of human motivation (McGhee, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 25 needs taken from the social and psychological literature, one of the main categories. 

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;
3. Personal integrative needs, including integration, self-esteem, cognitive dissonance;

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Congruently, McQuail’s (1963) classification of the following common reasons for media use:
