cleaned: In what way am I a beach? This is not a truly metaphorical question. I'm crouched standing up to my knees in the surf, straightening up, stretching as if I were about to dive into a wave of grain. Beach. I try to observe the area already. There are, of course, many beaches in the world but there is only one. After the Residence (the rock where Jen and I shoulder us when we are talking about hard things) there is only one nest for me. Here I come, listening in the sun, at seven-fifths of stopped-up wound around.
