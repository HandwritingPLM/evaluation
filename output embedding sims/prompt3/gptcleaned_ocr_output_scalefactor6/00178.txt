Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition of media research. The original conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of certain media contents. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1952). There exists a basic idea in this approach that media users are active in selecting content, and which media they use to meet their needs.

The approach suggests that individuals determine the media that fulfill their needs based on certain modes and their gratifications the media provides. This approach differs from traditional perspectives in that it regards audiences as active participants rather than passive consumers of information. In contrast to traditional models that focus on "what media do to people" and assume audiences are passive, uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). It relates personal motives to media use and responds to their needs, which are driven by social and psychological factors. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates that some individuals are more media content in terms of media platforms and content in consideration of public perspectives. In the perspective, audiences come to be seen as active individuals with a choice by assessing their media needs for using media. While the approach has gained criticism for being too focused on individual gratifications rather than social implications of media consumption, it remains an essential category in understanding media use.

Further, this approach provides a valuable framework for understanding media consumption and usage within the discipline. Recognizing media as part of the media environment and understanding media and its role in society.
