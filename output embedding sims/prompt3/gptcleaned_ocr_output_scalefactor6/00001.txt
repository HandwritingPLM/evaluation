OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1. Other Propaganda Theorists

L.A Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the components of propaganda, and investigating the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating 'The mass communication procedure of command states' (Rogers, 1984). Generally, content analysis can be defined as "the investigation of communication foci by categorizing responses into specific classifications in order to ease causal inferences" (Rogers, 1984). In an article titled 'Communications of Cooperation,' Lasswell (1952) detailed four content areas a media analyst should take into account: the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a category, the directions in which the symbols proceed the audience, and the congruity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1952) aims at achieving the goal of understanding the "sources of influence that arise from communicative convergence and benefit a given audience" (p. 74).

The core of content analysis, stated formally by Lasswell (1952), early defined communication as 'who says what in which channel to whom and with what effect.' Content analysis has been the mainstay of Lasswell's analytical work within his field, enabling him to generate key insights in shaping public opinion within a democratic society (Rogers, 1994). Verily, citizens must accept the power that media has in affecting their decisions. This influence has only increased since Lippmann's time.

2. Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

An important character that emerges in the work of the father of Public Relations (PR), Edward Bernays, is the concept of Engineering Consent. Bernays thought deeply about how to persuade, manipulate, and manage student opinion, believing these practices to be beneficial for society as a whole rather than for the individual. As he famously stated, "We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of." With this belief, Bernays sought to shape public opinion for the greater good, gathering, analyzing, and framing information to influence public opinion for specific purposes. The forward-facing nature of modern media often conceals these operations, making them hard to detect.
