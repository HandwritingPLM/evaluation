Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the system: langue and the performance: parole. Langue is the set of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material of the signals which compose it, as opposed to parole, which covers the purely individual part of language (Derrida, 1997, p. 13). Barthes then interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The system level, langue, is the social convention of values shared through a society which is embodied and reenacted. On the contrary, parole is the actual expression of the individual speech. However, it is considered relatively feeble due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from its shared convention, because language is therefore, a social institution and system of values, it is the social part of language. It is essentially a collection of signs which one must access in order to communicate. It's because language behaves as a system of arbitrary values and institution. Barthes illustrates how one uses language with the intent of expressing personal thoughts. It is the creative activity that constitutes the essence of articulate; to articulate thought, one must use language with the aim of expressing personal thoughts. This is why language has the ability to signify value and institution. Language may be seen as an activity, one engages in when communicating two or more individuals. In order to engage in such activity, one must be able to participate. In contrast, Saussure distinguishes that language system bears two parts. The signifier is the outer expression of an idea, while the signified is the inner idea and meaning respectively by signified (Langella).
