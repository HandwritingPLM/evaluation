J. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

Other Propaganda Theorists
1.0 Harold Lasswell (1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1978) was a pioneer methodologist in the analysis of propaganda, exploring both the methods and qualities and effects of propaganda, and charting the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994; cited in Political Communication theories). Generally, content analysis can be defined as "a systematic examination of recorded human communications by categorizing varying elements in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1964). Lasswell (1954) explained that a content analysis helps to identify the frequency with which certain events appear in messages, the direction in which the story is presented, the science's appeal, and the fidelity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of these messages, one can achieve the goal of understanding the flow of influences that goes from context to content and from content to audience.

This method of communication led directly to Lasswell's (1952) early definitions of communication, which state, "Who says what in which channel with what effect to whom on what effect." Content analysis eras essentially the analysis of what goes into a message, and Lasswell conducted a lot of work within this area during the trendsetter and his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion while also working in his essay on a cycle where the public buys into the information that is being shared, where information aids in shaping their decision-making within the domain where they are and the media are bought by the government. This balance of power that existed is Lippmann's theory.

2. Bernard Berelson (1912-2005)

Around the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda, Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was analyzing public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Berelson (1942) defines propaganda as, "a deliberate, systematic effort to shape perceptions, manipulate opinions, and influence public actions on behalf of particular objectives, whether commercial, ideological, or political" (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bernays believed that propaganda could be either beneficial or detrimental to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think about or alter the opinions of individuals but may not actually be beneficial to society as a whole. Bernays asserts, "We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. Vain under of human beings can cooperate in this manner if they are wo [ie google as a reputable designing society" (p. 8). Based on this idea that public opinion can be manipulated, and that shaping it is a necessary part of society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of public relations. "Public relations saves, by information, persuasion, and suggestion, at every point of contact, and at every moment" (p. 9).

Lastly, F. Abindia Feeney's case of Coca-Cola (1955) has detailed the importance of understanding the public and developing a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relations campaign is adjustment of the campaign to the attitudes of various groups in society, gathering information to effectively express an idea, and ultimately, convincing people to influence their own opinions in the desired direction.

Bernays' work represents a new forward for mass communication theory. They moved away from traditional perceptions of "harmful propaganda" and instead paved a new path for more transparent and ethical communication tactics.
