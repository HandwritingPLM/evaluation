i. EARLY INFLUENCE

Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.
Many theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to seduce.

Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their work can best be reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1974).

1. Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduating, Festinger initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but then followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and in the development of UBT. Festinger is best known for his theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) aimed to
explain how an imbalance between cognitions might affect one's perception. Lewin first discussed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1957). CDT allows for three
possible relationships with each other: a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other; a consonant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect; and
an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions do not impact each other. Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an effect on various behaviors that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory suggests that individuals compare themselves to others who are similar on the well-being scale and
this may result in conformity processes (Tedeschi & Felson, 2004). Berger and Calabrese further
expanded on social comparison theory by stating that “Festinger applied a principle of
comparisons to satisfactions with rewards [in] experiences” (Berger & Calabrese, 1974, p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist Award from the American Psychological

Society for his theoretical

contributions, and in a
satire, considered receiving

an honorary doctorate in psychology from the University of East Podunk
Heber, stating that “Festinger, like Pavlov, has affected much of my thinking, much of which was
in their bones and derives directly from his work” (Heber, 1995).

The writings in this book, also an alumnus of Smith College and later the University of
alone Lake University, as well as In 1928, He wrote an essay (Ash, 2000).
