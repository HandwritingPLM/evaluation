Uncertainty Reduction

Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the field's inception, the study of information has been a longstanding focus for communication research and the development of communication models. Information exchange is a basic human interaction in which individuals provide and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uncertainty reduction theory (URT), credited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that reducing uncertainty was central to matters of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars furthered the field of interpersonal communication by highlighting its importance in relationship development, conflict resolution, and trust-building ("One of the most fundamental needs in communication is the acquisition of information that reduces uncertainty" p. 30). The study of uncertainty is not only a fundamental aspect of communication, but also reveals the complexity of uncertainty in particular contexts and informs theoretical frameworks for a wide range of interpersonal interactions. The role of communication in the reduction of uncertainty is crucial to the field's advancement.

The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

The study of human behavior in social interactions has been an ongoing pursuit in communication research to understand how individuals form relationships and navigate the complexities of personal and professional interactions. Researchers seek to uncover patterns and dynamics that shape the development and maintenance of relationships. Evident in the history of communication research is a commitment to exploring and addressing the challenges associated with human communication in various contexts and settings.
