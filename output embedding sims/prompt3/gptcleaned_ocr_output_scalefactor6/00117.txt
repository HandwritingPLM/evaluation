Rogers was born in Caroll, Iowa in 1931. He earned his BA, MA, and PhD degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, in 1984, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Rome. 
The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and its applications of diffusion theory in such fields as geography, communication, psychology, political science, and, as previously mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2008.
According to Rogers (1995), diffusion refers to "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation can be an idea, practice, or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adaption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels" (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass communication, people can get information about an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, SMCR, i.e., sender-message-channel-receiver-effe!!. Rogers (2005) mentioned, "this S. MCR communication model can be applied to the characteristics of diffusion" (p. 1). Specifically, (1) senders can be innovators or opinion leaders, (2) messages can be news items or prepack, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass media, (4) receivers can be members of a certain system, and finally, (5) the effects can be individuals' adoption of social change. In the diffusion theory, the "time" variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (2005), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1) the innovation-decision process, (2) innovativeness, (3) an innovation's rate of adoption. Most innovations show an S-shaped curve of adoption. Different categories of adopters show different trajectories of adoption. For instance, early adopters and opinion leaders adopt faster than the late majority and laggards. However, the decision-making process is different. Figures show the relationship between types of adopters based on innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, though categories follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Several weasel factors drive diffusion. The figure shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in an S-shaped curve. However, since different types of innovators exist, the rate of adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed corn case. However, the decision-making process is different. Figures show the shapes of curves of diffusions for innovations Source by: www.milvuc.co. jp'english case cem! In terms of the process of innovation-decision, Pepper (1995) mentioned that there are five stages.
1. Knowledge (collective exposure of awareness of an innovation).
2. Persuasion (people hear positions or messages attitude inward innovations).
3. Adoption (Decision: people decide to adopt the innovation).
4. Implementation (regular or standard practices).
5. Confirmation (competing and evaluating).
