Berger COC states: "these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal angle
agenda during the past few decades" (p. 416). Today, Interpersonal Communication has a

on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, often
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger and Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction in the 1950s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
on the theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty in communication theory. Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and central in our
understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct necessary for the study of commu-
nication, it would be beneficial to learn when the concept originated and how it has been defined
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty is based on a given situation where there
is a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence is unknown.
Shannon and Weaver related the view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of WRT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theories, as well as Heller (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the "number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 501). The greater the
breadth of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre-
dict behavior and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with perceptions of
predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners believe or behave in the way
that they do. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can result from the large number of alternative things
that a stranger can believe or potentially want" (uncertainty plays a significant role when examining
relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty =
100, Incompetent Communicators may not be able to develop relationships or sustain proper
Interactions. Within initial interactions, West gay & Turner (2000) note that fewer levels of uncertainty
in increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of interaction, and increased liking, this

Means that one can expand to some predictability with the goal that this will lead to little-
predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty is inerent,
Difficult to reach this goal. Although individual selves are less used and are not often
predictability can also inhibit a relationship, Heath and Tracey also see comfort in a view of certainty
and predictability can weaken a relationship: they state: "Too much certainty"
