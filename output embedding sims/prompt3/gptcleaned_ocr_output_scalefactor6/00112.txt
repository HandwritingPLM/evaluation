Defining Uncertainty

Research conducted under the label of interpersonal communication initially focused on parent
social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of beaming, disorientation, id -

ance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2006). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of Social psychology,
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars
as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the century
and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hayes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Fees (2005) state: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication
discipline over the past several decades” (as cited in). "Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, and communication as

a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its inception in the 1950s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of inquiry that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
on those scholars who pioneered the concept of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work

is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our
understanding of interpersonal processes.
