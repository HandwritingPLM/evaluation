Critical response to "The Culture Industry"

I am compelled to be clear about the sceptical students at the University who were making teaching impossible. In the winter semester of 1958 eleven students occupied a number of buildings at the University of Frankfurt, including the Institute in Sol Hagen. Dr. Pleyer is in charge of teaching, but his lectures continue to be cancelled more and more often. As soon as Professor Deines and his student assistant bestir themselves a little, the situation will no doubt change drastically.
