Uses and Gratifications

1.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tract in media research. The original conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of Can Mad Conk. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1994). There are key ideas in this approach: audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.

In the mass communication process, the uses and gratifications approach puts the function of linking needs, gratifications, and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use certain media, and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users who are diverse in what media they engage with and assume audiences are heterogeneous, uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with what people do with media (Katz, Blumler, & Gurevitch, 1974). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide a wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different media.

This approach emphasizes audiences' choice by assessing their reasons for using media to the disregard of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained through the media based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin & Tankard, 1997). A broader perspective from cultural sociology provides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants' information of content selectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Pasadeos et al., 1976). Audience members then incorporate the content fully into their lives.

It is accepted that communication theories have developed through the works of PAE: individuals and sociology over the past 10 years. With more unified fields in these two disciplines, researchers can have higher conceptions of understanding media.
