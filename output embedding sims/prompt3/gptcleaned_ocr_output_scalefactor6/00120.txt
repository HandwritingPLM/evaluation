L. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1. Other Propaganda Theorists
Lippmann was writing propaganda. Harold Lasswell was undertaking critical analyses of in
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was created by Harold Lasswell (1902-1978). A prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both qualitative and quantitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the concepts of propaganda, and discovering the effects of propaganda on the audience (Rogers, 44). Lasswell is credited with creating the message communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 55). Generally, content analyses can be defined as " ..the covert order of communication moving from categories of communication to classification terms for order to measure categories" (Rogers, 156). In an essay titled "The Structure of Communication," Lasswell explains that a content analyzed should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and the intensity of the reactions needed. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell also emphasizes the importance of understanding the "chain of influence that extends from one communicator to criticize and from one audience to another" (p. 74).
This method of correspondence has been tied strongly to Lasswell's observational communication which is stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 254). Content analysts work diligently to interpret this concept and the obstacles that may arise within the democratic system, and it's being presented by them may be of great interest. This interesting way of working prevents the approximate, arbitrary, and also the appropriateness to accept it. However, it is seen that the complexinations are affecting their concepts within the democratic system and are being presented by them may be of great interest.

This ban is reducing the way of wire of the prevention of that analysis that is based on the similar to Lipschitz's theories.

2. Edward Bernays (1891-1995) 

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Laswell were formalizing public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was creating public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Beyond the mere creation, he aimed at creating a system of persuasive appeals to influence the minds of the public both as a collective whole but also the individual; ideas or groups (p. 83). Like other propaganda theorists, Bernays acknowledges that propaganda can be more beneficial than bad per se in the sense that it can shape or alter the opinions of individuals, turning one's company or authority to seek their favor on anybody. Bernays postulates, "As they are preyed, not purchased, they are consumed by individuals, or voiced by individuals, largely being changed for systems rather than mass persuasion." 

Can anyone deny that the public spirit can be modulated, which shares the main task between the public education, "Peace relations there starts a two-way process of education, for each side campaigns, to like, react, or to see it as a liberating (Bernays, 1999).
