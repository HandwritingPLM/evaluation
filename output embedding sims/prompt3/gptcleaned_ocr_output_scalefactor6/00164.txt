Like many other structuralist theorists, Barthes was influenced by structural linguistics. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels: the synchronic and the diachronic. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematic aspect of communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which it corresponds to. Speech (parole), on the other hand, is concerned with the act of signaling in actual moments (Barthes, 1957, p.14).

Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic theory as extending into the social dimension. The structural level in language, therefore, refers to the social convention or norms within a society, which are structured and standardized. In the sociolinguistic context, parole is flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be entirely predefined. 

A language is, therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the shared part of language where one must understand it in its entirety if one wishes to communicate effectively. It has a subjective aspect but resides in modifications stemming from individual choice and interpretation. Speech is an index of these modifications and actualizations. The speaking subject uses the language code to express personal thoughts. Speech acts as a mediator between society's conventional norms and individual actions and aspirations (Barthes, 1957, pp.14-16).

Focusing on the symbolic nature, Barthes distinguishes between the signifier and the signified. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the signifier. The form is called the sign, which is the real part of language. For example, the word "dog" in English or in French carries the same signifier but expresses different meanings. Here, the actual primordial concept becomes the signified. Barthes suggests a new way to designate the whole and to replace oneself and others in respect to deconstruction and interpretation. Each sign plays a role in forming a structure of signifiers and signifieds. According to Saussure's consideration of linguistic study, these elements are organized in a signifying system. Barthes emphasizes the importance of selecting signs within this system and creating meaning through combination. Signifiers interact with each other and establish relationships of meaning which are crucial to how language operates in a system (Barthes, 1957).
