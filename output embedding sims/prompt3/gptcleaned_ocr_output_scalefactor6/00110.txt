Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul are important for a number of reasons. Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that the public can be easily influenced by outside sources. He also acknowledges the need to understand the influence of media on the public. Through the work of scholars like Page, Lewin, and McLuhan, a more comprehensive understanding of the role of media in society has been developed. The public has access to numerous media channels such as television, radio, and the internet, each with its own agenda and control. The effects that media can have on individuals can be profound.

The theories presented in this paper are tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited specific propaganda could have on the thoughts of the audience. While the theories of Lippmann are notable for the idea that the media might be influencing public opinion, it may also be influenced by what people think. This line of thinking resulted in a foundation laid for future work by scholars such as Perloff, Weber, as well as McCornack and Shan. Understanding the work of these scholars is crucial in comprehending the media, the techniques used in persuasion, and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul may seem complex, they contribute to a better understanding of the way these theories operate in the world today.
