Like many structuralists, Saussure is emphasizing that meaning is essentially arbitrary. Because one signifier, like 'water' or 'mother,' can be substituted for (another i.e girl} or vice versa, Saussure notes that this can lead different interpretive outcomes. To illustrate the difference, consider the follow sentence: "I went to the theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is constructed through a linear combination of signs: 'I,' 'theater,' and 'girlfriend,' can be replaced by other signs in the same paradigm set. In other words, Saussure is saying that signs do not derive their meaning from their individual significance, but rather through their relationships with each other and how they are arranged in a sequence which generates meaning.
