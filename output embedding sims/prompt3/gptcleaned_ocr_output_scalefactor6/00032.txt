Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

The core of information theory rests a strong foundation in the area of uncertainty. Informed exchange is a basic human activity in which individuals seek, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty, uncertainty reduction theory (URT), established by Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), asserts that reducing uncertainty was a central objective of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars promoted the field of interpersonal communication by emphasizing its critical role in uncertainty reduction. Heath and Orton (1980) state "One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty" (p. 159). The exchange of information is fundamental to all modes of communication, yet in relation to the study of uncertainty in particular, advanced theoretical work in the field of interpersonal communication has been crucial. URT places the role of communication at the central core which was a key element in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Calabrese (1975) note "When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal communication process, they have identified developing theories to help guide our understanding of this process" (p. 5). The research underlying this theory and efforts made by contemporary scholars marked the emergence of interpersonal communication research. The impact of URT on research has been profound, leading researchers to look back at the early origins of our understanding of communication processes and the continued development of how we perceive communication. Traditionally, communication studies have been rooted in disciplines such as interpersonal communication which have been influenced by fields like linguistics, social psychology, and sociology. By the 1970s, only a small portion of research was compiled under the umbrella of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant (1980) pointed out the origin of the field of interpersonal communication "particularly since 1980, an emphasis on the central themes of the field have brought forth significant and concrete impacts of interpersonal relationships" (p. 53). The authors stress the importance of the development of how we perceive interpersonal communication as both a field of research and a central part of our everyday lives. Research is increasingly applied to understanding the internal and external forces, challenges, and psychological problems that arise as a result of relationships between individuals.
