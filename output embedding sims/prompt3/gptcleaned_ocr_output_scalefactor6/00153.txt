According to Rogers (1983), diffusion refers to ideas spread through certain channels over time and is a social process. An innovation is an idea perceived as new by members of a social system. An innovation includes five parts: 
1. Knowledge 
2. Persuasion 
3. Decision 
4. Implementation 
5. Confirmation 

The process by which an individual adopts an innovation involves four main elements: 
1. Innovation 
2. Communication channels 
3. Time 
4. Social system 

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Rogers (1983): 
1. Innovators 
2. Early Adopters 
3. Early Majority 
4. Late Majority 
5. Laggards 

Rogers defined this term as "the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other members of his social system" (Rogers, 1983, p. 40%). Figure 1 shows the relationships between types of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. The two curves follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped.

There are five stages: 
1. Knowledge 
2. Persuasion 
3. Decision 
4. Implementation 
5. Confirmation
