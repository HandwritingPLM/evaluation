f, Growth of "The Culture Industry"

Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to understand the main and diremolecular line of the idea of the culture industry as well as its conception, the concept can be a pre-condition, through its general orientation, to its subsequent effect. The culture industry poses a potent impact. The idea of production of culture, reaching out to the masses through making significant images (like in cinema and radio) visible, can be seen growing and evolving. 

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree, he did not have the opportunity to search for a university position, something that prompted Adorno to become Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin's death, Adorno, who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academia. The relationship with Benjamin had a profound impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute. Adorno began lecturing at the Institute in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and Adorno began operating there. The Nazi rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and was forced to flee Germany, but it also affected his philosophical thinking. Along with Max Horkheimer, Adorno was largely responsible for the development of critical theory, along with Stalinist repression and the mass culture of the United States. 

Adorno was at Oxford from 1954 onwards, where he worked on examining Plato's writings. He was considered a prodigy, eventually transitioning into the academic world and convincing his Greek high school colleagues, many of whom had fled to the United States. Already by the '60s, Adorno had expanded his field of interest to include cultural propaganda and entertainment, these ideas enhanced during the 1930s. Benjamin and Adorno derived their culture, such as films and radio shows, from the period of popular art. Adorno's views on culture were increasingly shaped by less racist and more fascist ideologies. This work led to some controversial pieces, such as the famous "The Art of Listening" and its effect on the rise of fascist ideals. Adorno's critical position was that art was being commodified and degraded, leading to a mechanical and fake aesthetic. Adorno believed that art had the power to undermine hierarchical power structures and promote authenticity. To Benjamin, the historical gap is crucial for Adorno's work to have meaning and bring about change. 

In short, Benjamin was the only one to write for the Institute, as he worked on bringing Serbian culture to a more global audience. Adorno's contributions were indeed significant.
