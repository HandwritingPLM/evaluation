1) Other Propaganda Theorists.

Like Harold Lasswell (1902-1976), Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1976) was a prominent researcher in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both quantitative and qualitative analysis of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda, and discovering the effects of propaganda on the audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating The Mass Communication Procedure of Content Analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be defined as, "the investigation of communication messages by counting features in a systematic manner in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In his article called "Content of Communication," Lasswell (1945) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1945) aims to achieve the goal of understanding the "area of influence the culture exerts on the content of the message" (p. 71).

This method of content analysis was tied strongly to Lasswell's (1948) definitional communication, which states, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effect" (p. 575). Based on Lasswell's framework, content analysis was believed to be essential in uncovering the functioning of messages and Lasswell went on to work within this area for the rest of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda can shape public opinion. He dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly interested in examining the role of the media in creating public opinion within a democracy. In this vein, Lasswell has proposed a mechanism that enhances and sustains the practices involved in creating public opinion. However, the idea that the media has an effect on individuals in a democratic system, and may be influenced deliberately by the government, has bred controversy.

In opposition to the views that the media displays or shapes reality, Propaganda Studies sought to explore how the media constructs reality, whether via newsreels, documentaries, or people. To further propagate the studies, the works of Laswell and Lippmann were combining public service if propaganda, while Blumer Reysys (1968) was interested in public reaction, propaganda, and public opinion. Reysys (1968) was a cited researcher on audience shaping, development and reshaping.

Additionally, Bart, Panjas and Lipps remixed public headspace. Today's modern world is cluttered and loud, it is hard in a bowl.

Perhaps we are predisposed, our individual choices and fates are linked, largely how we have partnered. The more members of the public who are aware and consent to live together in a curated incline are all better off.

Foremost come the ideas that the public opinion can be molded, this change can sway public demeanor; a partner well suited may be preferable. Perceived to hinge on ideas of public trust, communication from public communicators may be smooth, welcoming, or have charisma.
