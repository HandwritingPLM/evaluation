Uses and Gratifications

1.4 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original 
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of 
certain media contents. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media 
and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1980) There exists a basic idea in this approach: 
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs 
in the communication process. Uses and gratifications approach puts the function of 
linking needs, gratifications, and media choice clearly on the side of audience members, as 
people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use certain media and 
what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to passive receivers of information. Unlike Reception or Gatekeeping Theories which focus on "what media do to people" and assume audiences are homogeneous, needs and gratification approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz 1955). It also considers audiences' personal needs and how they interact with the media, which is determined by their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates that the media compete with other information sources in an audience's need satisfaction (Riffe et al. 1994). As traditional media and new media continue to provide people with a 
wide range of media platforms and content, this approach remains one of the most appropriate 
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be engaged in different media. The approach studies audiences' choice by assessing their reasons for using a certain media and the various gratifications obtained from the media, based on individual social and psychological needs (Katz & Blumler, 1974). Understanding the processes by which audience participants seek 
information or content selectively, in line with their individual interests and preferences. 
Audiences then incorporate the content to fit their needs or to satisfy their interests 
(Lowery & Wirtz, 1983).

1.2 Origin and History

It is well acknowledged that audience theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology over the past 100 years. With insights from these valuable disciplines, researchers gain a sense of higher 
applications of understanding media.
