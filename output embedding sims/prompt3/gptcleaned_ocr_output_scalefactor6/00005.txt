Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1908. During the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, he worked on some military planning communications. The book has become a key textbook on diffusion theory and interests a wide audience. It has applications in various fields such as agriculture, sociology, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was battling kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1908), diffusion refers to the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation can be an idea, practice, or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels. That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass media, people can gain information about an innovation and perceive the innovation as useful. Lind (1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-H-O-C-R. Rogers (1985) mentioned, "this S-H-O-C-R communication model corresponds closely with the elements of diffusion" (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally, (5) the effect can be an individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, the "Time" variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (SL), this variable is involved in the diffusion model of the innovation-decision process; Innovators, early adopters, and early majorities have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion near "border" or acceptance rate differs from other variables and countries. Rogers (1985) highlighted the importance of personal influences and key participants in the adoption of an innovation, as well as the characteristics of an individual's social system. 

Regarding the innovation, if an idea passes through communication channels, it can be perceived more efficiently. That is, if the idea powers up library networks and creates communication, it may be easier explained to different audiences. (1) Innovators (2) Early Adopters, (3) Early Majority (Early Majority) (4) Late Early Majority (Late Majority=) Rogers defined them as 'Innovators' (1), Early Adopters (2), Early Majority (3), and Late Majority (Rogers, 198). He emphasized that high and influential individuals are earlier in adopting the idea than others in their social system (Rogers, 15). 

Individuals influenced by their awareness are part of the adoption processes, seeking the following: they are open to a new idea and go through society at various stages or points of view (Rogers, 1985) mentioned that:

- When a response corresponds to five elements:
1. Knowledge
2. Convincing
3. Decision
4. Implementation
5. Confirmation
