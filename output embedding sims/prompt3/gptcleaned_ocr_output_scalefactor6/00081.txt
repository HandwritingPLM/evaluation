Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the work of these professionals, it is evident that the public is often influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and others has also shed light on the power of propaganda and the impact it can have on the public. Through research by Lasswell, Wright, Gwyn, and Moss, and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of the media has been developed. The theories have now been applied to various functions such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and framing, highlighting the potential dangers that arise when propaganda is used to manipulate the thoughts of the masses. Critics argue that while the media may not always directly control behavior, they do shape perceptions and influence people's opinions. This line of thinking has laid the groundwork for future research in the area of limited media effects. Scholars such as Lang, Kitzinger, and McCroskey, as well as Chaffee, have all contributed significantly to the development of this field, shedding light on the ways in which media can both inform and manipulate public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and others were developed years ago, they continue to provide valuable insights into the society we live in today.
