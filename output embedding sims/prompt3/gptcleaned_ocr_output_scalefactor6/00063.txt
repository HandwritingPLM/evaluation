Defining Uncertainty

ou Wetainty has been identified as an IPC concept, necessary to the scope of commu

NCAT, while Ge Gerefical go know then the Concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (189) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
were a number of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively low. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of WRT. Berger and Calabrese (14 H) adopted concepts from the
information theory as well as Helder (1355) research in anticipation. Berger and Calabrese (25)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to include "predictions about the behavior of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. IK). The greater the number

of alternatives, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre-

dict with certainty how others will behave or what will happen. Uncertainty plays a significant role in communication, as individuals are expected to increase their efforts in predicting and explaining behaviors. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the mere number of alternative courses of behavior a given interactant might believe or perceive as salient." Uncertainty can lead to difficulties in initial interactions as individuals may not be able to develop relationships or may be too anxious. Mest & Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty correspond to increased verbal and nonverbal interactions, as individuals are expected to increase their efforts to predict and explain behaviors. However, it can be difficult to reach this goal.

Increased levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can also lead to low levels of communicative competence. Mest & Turner (2000) state that individuals with high levels of uncertainty may not be able to develop relationships or may be too anxious. Heath and Bey Et (Sil) state that higher uncertainty levels can undermine the predictability and reliability of a relationship;

and predictability can deepen a relationship.
