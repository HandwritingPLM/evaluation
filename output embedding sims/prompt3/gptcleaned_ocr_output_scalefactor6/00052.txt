2. EARLY INFLUENCES

These findings then had a significantly contributed to the development of interpersonal uncertainty in communication. The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1944 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics after Lewin's death. Following that, he worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research. Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of SRT. Festinger is best known for the theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) explains how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual, a concept previously forecasted by Lewin in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three relationships to occur among cognitive and consonant relationships, in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other, a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other, and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions involved have no effect on one another (West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance Theory is founded on the themes of arousal and discomfort. Individuals seek to reduce these. Social Comparison Theory postulates that individuals seek feedback from others to evaluate themselves, as individuals typically seek the opinions of others who are similar to themselves when experiencing a high level of uncertainty regarding their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation (Festinger, 1954). Festinger received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's legacy is significant, and his theoretical influences can be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (1980) stated, "It was in this era that Leon Festinger developed his theory of cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since" (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider obtained his doctorate in psychology after the uncertainty of war, during his time in Europe. He worked with mathematicians and psychologists such as Max Wertheimer and Kurt Lewin. Heider, similar to Festinger, acknowledged Lewin as a substantial influence on his work: "I want to pay tribute to Lewin's molding influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which is still strong and alive in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work" (Heider, 1958, p. viii). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 1980).
