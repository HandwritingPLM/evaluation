i. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Researchers conducted several studies to examine the role of interpersonal communications in small group leadership, specifically focusing on leadership, dominance, conflict, and influence (Berger, 2004). Karl Lewis, a professor of social psychology, also demonstrated how an employee's performance can be influenced by a leader. Furthermore, Fordice and Harlow show how the social skills of a leader can enhance relational development and the building of team trust. In addition, the impact of Berger's theory suggests that relational communication is integral to shaping interpersonal communication in various contexts, shaping individuals' perceptions and behaviors (Burger, 2004). Berger also stated, "The central theoretical idea is that social interactions can shape individual knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors through direct interaction, observation, or communication from others" (p. 5). Interpersonal communication is often seen as the foundation of development and the basis of all relationships. It has been suggested that interpersonal communication should be viewed as a skill Berger established. Social laws like the golden rule, empathy, have provided the basis on which the leader must build. This chapter aims to portray these variable relationships in team spirit within the group dynamic. 

The central focus of this text reflects the importance of defining uncertainty, primarily within a small group. The complex web of social theories, concepts, and their influences must be understood to appreciate the impact they have on the dynamic of an organization. Uncertainty can be viewed as a specific type of ambiguity and complexity that explains the uncertain and vague flow of information. Essentially, uncertainty refers to the possibility of multiple outcomes and the likelihood of unexpected results. Understanding uncertainty is essential to making informed decisions as it can significantly impact an individual's perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors in daily interactions and relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely hinder effective communication and create barriers to success in personal and professional relationships. Developing strategies to navigate uncertainty and manage unpredictability is crucial in fostering trust and enhancing collaboration among team members. This text explores the intricacies of uncertainty from various perspectives and the importance of addressing uncertainty to improve overall communication effectiveness.
