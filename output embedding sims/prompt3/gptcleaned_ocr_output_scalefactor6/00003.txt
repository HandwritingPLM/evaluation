1 Early Influences

Therefore, uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.
The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle for individuals to reduce uncertainty.

1.1) Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication. The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1.1) Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University ofews under the direction of Kurt Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a profound influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, he initially worked at the University of Korkesner, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin died, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Sumelson, 2004). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and in the development of LRT. Festinger is best known for the theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) attempted to explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Festinger understood CDT in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other, a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other, and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another (Festinger & Turner). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and discomfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison Theory postulates that individuals look to feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To gauge their performance, the individual seeks the opinions of others who are similar to themselves. This need for social comparison can lead to uncertainty in certain circumstances (Trenanin & Ieas, 2018). Berger and Calabrese (1975) applied social comparison theory to LRT by stating that "Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others who are proximal when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of their behavior or opinions in a particular situation" (p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's legacy is significant, and his theoretical influence can be recognized in contemporary social and psychological research. Aaron during Festinger, (1981) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of Cognitive Dissonance, and his opinion, still psychologically best, was the greatest since the origin of the game: alone” (p. 7).

1.1.2) Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider was a pivotal figure in the development of theories related to social psychology. Like Festinger, he acknowledged Lewin as a substantial influence on his life. "I pay tribute to Lewin - a living influence, which has influenced much of my thinking and which is still seen clearly in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work" (Heider, 1958, p. 5). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Swarthmore College and later at the University of Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his academic career.
