1, THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything Adorno had seen in Europe. Furthermore, the prevalence of advertising in the United States had no correlative in Europe. The closest thing in Adorno's experience to the advertising industry in the United States was fascist propaganda (Jaeger, 2010, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting: the statistical division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop the concept of the culture industry.

One of the relationships within the Institute for Social Research was with Horkheimer, who had already been residing part-time in America since November (Ivt, Wien. See also Bevacqua, pazz Be durake,). The group included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Bertolt Brecht, several of whom found work in the film industry as part of this intellectual community whose experiences with culture, since the Weimar Republic years, must have had some influence in developing the new landscape they enjoyed in exiled Germany.

Adorno's interest in mass culture stemmed from his relationship with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with Theodor Adorno, catered to his understanding of the leadership of several of them in the Hollywood Film Industry.

His concern for the effects of the culture industry ran parallel to his belief in high art, as opposed to popular or commercial culture.
