Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of certain media contents. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1952). There exists a basic idea in this approach beyond content, namely which media they use to meet their needs.

It suggests that certain media serve specific needs and what gratifications the media provides. The traditional perspective in that it regards audience as active participants in media consumption, as opposed to traditional model that merely focuses on "what media do to the people" and assumes audiences are passive. The uses and gratifications approach is more concerned with "what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). It explores personal reasons to use media and respond to them, which are driven by social and psychological backgrounds. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates that some people are more active media consumers than others, as well as the problem which media platforms and content, in considering public perspectives enable audiences to be empowered. Different perspective emerges for choice by analyzing their motivations for using media. History has revealed some individuals who are adept in deciphering media content and the underlying messages that it conveys.

The categories have served various purposes in diverse research traditions. Interdisciplinary collaboration has emerged in the field of media studies as well.
