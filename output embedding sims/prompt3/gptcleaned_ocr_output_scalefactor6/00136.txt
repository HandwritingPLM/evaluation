Larry is Carmel, born in 1931. He earned his BA, MA, and PhD degrees from Harvard University. For four years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force initially planning communication projects in Korea. Once away from military service, he worked on diffusion theory and its diverse applications in geography, political science, and, as previously mentioned, communication. Ropers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2X because he was suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 1, 20%.

According to Rogers (HAG. diffusion refers to the process in which information is transmitted from specific channels over time among the members of a social system and a practice or object perceived as an innovation by an individual or other unit of adoption. The spread of innovations involves both interpersonal and intrapersonal communication channels. As Rogers (1946) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, E-M-C-R-E (under-media reach channels communication). Rogers (195) mentioned, "The E-M-C-Basic model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion" (p. 12). Specifically, (1) seeders can be innovators or opinion leaders, (2) the message can be a general idea or product, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, receivers can be members of a social system, and finally (5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, "time variable influences" according to Rogers (1995), time variable involve different factors in the interaction process: (1) innovativeness, (2) an innovation's rate of adoption. Most innovations have an S-shaped curve of adoption. Innovator research has aimed to explain the workability of the influence flow and identify audience characteristics anew through communication channels such as the Internet. Overlapping conclusion of web technology: interpersonal influences and social influence are key to the dissemination of innovations is every field of organizational effort. democratic processes are a target for rapid diffusion. One significant point to mention is that low tech innovations don't mean they are of low utility; quite the opposite, differing densities of adoption! or any project can lead to significant outcomes. State-of-the-art coverage and supportive environment of a convenience and the proper investment of time necessary to achieve a new perspective that is perceived by many as significant. Thus, the greater the perceived benefit, the more likely the diffusion process will proceed, albeit slowly or rapidly. Regardless, further research is needed for a more precise follow up on all of this.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Rogers: (1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (deliberate), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional) (Rogers, 13. pp, 1-185). Rogers defined this term as "the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other people divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Innovators follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Some innovations would spread through society over various periods of time in an S-shaped curve. However, as acted above, different population segments (e.g., the rate of adoption is different; some are faster than that of the hybrid systematic) can have their own different curves and definitions. Figure 2 presents that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in an S-shaped curve.

1. Knowledge + orâ€”(subjective exposure of awareness of news

2. Attitudes +09 = (people have positive or negative attitude toward innovation

3. Adopting (Decide: people decide to adopt the innovation

4. Implementing (regular or standard practice)

5. Confirmation (comparing and evaluating
