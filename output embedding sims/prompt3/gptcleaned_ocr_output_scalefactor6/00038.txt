The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For marketers, popular culture and media did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business, and this in turn became a threat to the art they intentionally produced (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 4). This process was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist rationalization, in which production was based on the techniques of assembly lines. Hence Ford was perceived in the cinematic sphere, rather than as the technological marvel it was (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.5). Examples of this can be seen in Adorno's Hollywood production analysis. The CIA's media network that had been co-opted with the Princeton Audio-Visual Project. More and more of these were based on standards, rather than the formidable art that was co-produced with these principles (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 76). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there could be no real change to the system, and that something truly original would be pushed to the wayside (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 75-6). Innocently, any rebellion like that of Sonic Youth and their work in breaking the rules by misappropriating "Teen Spirit" as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The authenticity in the ad was to numb the audience to any opposition and make it their own, without even knowing it was being done (Friedman, 1991, p. 105). Like religion and other mating practices, the cultural industry became both a mechanism of social control and a means of entertainment (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 130), but the freedom to choose from a variety of economic constraints ultimately meant the freedom to remain the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 138).

While Adorno had been, in his own right, an opponent of high cultureâ€”the Culture Industry being criticized as a defense of high art meant to pacify culture. Adorno specifically defined avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 10). Although this provided the idea of an opposing force to the dominant culture, Adorno went on to suggest, almost in passing, that the culture's ultimate capacity for mass consumption for entertainment as low as possible.

The Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defender of the elite, as opposed to popular arts and culture.
