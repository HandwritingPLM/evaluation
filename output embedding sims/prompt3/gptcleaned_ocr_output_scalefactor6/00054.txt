Refining Uncertainty

Research conducted under the titles of interpersonal accuracy dissonance, social influence, and small group processes, Theories of social psychology, appearance, and judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Key research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, 

played a considerable role in influencing a vast array of social interaction, 

relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the latter part of the decade 

as Knapp, Montirabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut, as Berger became popular 

along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation and communication research. 

Berger (2005) states: "these early theoretical forays helped shape the direction trends to come 

in academia during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication is 

a fundamental component of communication involving face-to-face interaction, 

and the function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication has also 

focused on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships, 

and has shown that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reductions (Berger of study that has 

Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major factor that has 

contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter surveys 

the theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Seeing pa

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined 

and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information 

theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there 

were a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal. 

Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work 

also contributed to the development of UAT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the 

information theorists as well as Heider (1950) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975) 

expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as 

the "number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the 

level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict 

behaviors and occurrences. During interactions, individuals are not only faced with problems of 

predicting present and past behavior but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way 

that they do. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this 

process when they stated "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things 

that a stranger can believe or potentially say." Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining 

relationships. A high level of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can 

cause stress and anxiety which can lead to lower levels of communicator competence (West & 

Turner, 2000). Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or may be too anxious 

to engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) show that lower levels of uncertainty caused 

increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking. In 

interactions, individuals are expected to increase predictability with the ability 

to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. Where uncertainty exists, 

more effort is required to preserve a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: "Too.
