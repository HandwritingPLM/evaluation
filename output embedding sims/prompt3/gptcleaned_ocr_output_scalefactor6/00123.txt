Needs and Gratifications

Needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the perceived needs of audience members. Gunter and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content can gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. On the contrary, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Gunther & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual’s background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people’s ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet those needs. That is, audience members are diverse and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person interaction” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivision of the larger concept of motivation was developed by Pelsoari (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of "affective cognitive and actions" and then added three dimensions: achievement versus passive orientation, external versus internal pole orientation, and emotional stability versus "growth" and "preservation." Eight factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to the structure of 16 general paradigms of human orientation (McGuire, 1974). Katz (1973) developed 35 items taken from the social and psychological functions of the media and grouped them into five categories.

Cognitive needs, including information, education, knowledge, and learning.
Affective needs, such as emotion, pleasure, satisfaction, and feelings.
Personal integration needs, credibility, stability.
Social interaction needs, companionship, social integration.
Escapist needs, including diversion, escapism, and fantasy.

These categories represent basic needs, including status and self-esteem, and how security, freedom, and autonomy. Likewise, these categories address questions of political and social situations. They identify the essential factors in time, space, and conditions in mediated states. Secure findings shall represent one's needs for decision-making and the practice of self-actualization and breakthrough in understanding and gaining a sense of security.
