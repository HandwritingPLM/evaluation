Needs and Gratifications

The teel assumptions were stated in a study by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974. They provide a framework for understanding the interaction between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of the mass media. The role of media use is essential in the goal-oriented activities of media use and is shaped by more or less definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience.

2. In the mass communication process, much initiative in finding gratification and media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on the theory about any form of direct effect of media content on attitudes and behavior.

3. The individual competes with other sources of satisfaction. The task assumed by mass communication constitutes only a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the extent to which they can be adequately met through media content certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be deduced from the data supplied by individual audience members themselves. People are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in such a way as to make them intelligible and form the basis for a viable formulation.

5. Value judgments concerning the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explicitly examined and treated. (pp. 15-17)

Additionally, Katz, Gurevitch, and Blumler also noted that although previous researchers on gratifications identified diverse gratifications that attract people to media use, they did not analyze the connection between these gratifications. They suggest that new and clarification research should focus on the following aspects: "[(1) the social and the psychological origins of] (2) needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources [which] lead to (5) differential exposure (or engagement in other activities), resulting in (6) gratification of needs, and so (7) other consequences, perhaps more concealed ones" (Katz et al., 1974, pp. 20). The studies by Blumler and Katz laid a theoretical foundation for bending the lines and generalizations approach. Since then, research on this topic has been strengthened and expanded. The current focus of uses and gratifications research, particularly due to new media forms emerging in an electronic information age when people have more options of media use.

**Need and Gratifications**

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Katz, Gurevitch, and Blumler (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication source for different motives depending on the satisfaction they seek. It was found that there are connections between (Harder & Katz, 1975) and situational variables that can affect people's understanding of what they want from media content and which media content to choose. Audience members are evidence of complex needs and gratifications when using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media person interactions." Four important needs identified are:
