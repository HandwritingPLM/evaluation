Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people use the same media content for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Conversely, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their interests. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media, behaviorly, Blumler and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-referent; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivision involving the audience's motivation was suggested by Fleur (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two Types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" mediation, "external versus internal" goal orientation, and operation stability of "growth" and "preservation." When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3) (McQuail, 1972). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1979) developed 25 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and list them as follows:

- Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;
- Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;
- Personal integrative needs, including creativity and intellectual;
- Social integrative needs, including socializing with family and friends, and
- Tension release needs including, escaping from cares and woes.

Klapper's (1965) classification of uses for media is as follows:
- finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world;
- obtaining advice on practical matters or opinion and decision choices;
- satisfying curiosity and miscellaneous interest;
- seeking self-definition;
- obtaining diversion or escape;
- maintaining interpersonal relationships;
- gaining reassurance of worth and value through knowledge;
- finding reinforcement for personal values;
- modeling behavior;
- identifying with valued others (in the media);
- gaining insight into oneself.
