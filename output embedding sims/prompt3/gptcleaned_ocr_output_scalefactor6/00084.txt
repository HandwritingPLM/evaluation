Viney, here are a few corrections for you to reread. It

seems to be an analysis of propaganda, it's not very clear. 

I think propaganda might help realign our perception of what is seen as the truth. But we are not too sure about the influence it does. It can be twisted and turned by anyone. The ease at which information can be manipulated is a big concern. This analysis is not a confirmation but rather an inquiry into propaganda. It might help us understand if it should be used or not. 

All commerce is susceptible to manipulation, persuasion, and deception. There is power and subtle influence in all actions. Behavior can be shifted just through the use of words and actions. In the end, propaganda is a silent actor in many events. 

We need to reconsider and rethink all actions and events that are taking place. 

Maybe everything is just a facade when it comes to power.
