Uncertainty Reduction

In Advances in Interpersonal Communication, Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese, and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the nineteenth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communications research with the development of Communication Theory. Information exchange and behavior can be affected by the exchange of information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. The study of uncertainty reduction theory was initiated by Charles Berger and Richard Calabrese in 1972, recognizing that reducing uncertainty was a central aspect of communication. Through the development of UBT, these scholars advanced the field of interpersonal communication by providing a sound and reliable basis for uncertainty research. Heath and Baack (2000) state: "One of the key underpinnings of interpersonal communication is the question of information with which to reduce uncertainty." The study of information is fundamental to all fields of communication, but it is especially relevant to understanding uncertainty in interpersonal communication research. URT plays a pivotal role in communication, integrating uncertainty as a critical factor in the development of interpersonal communication. Berger and Calabrese (1975) noted: "As communication researchers have conducted extensive research on interpersonal communication processes, they have turned to employing social psychological theories as a guiding framework." The research exploring the theories and models made by older communication scholars paved the way for interpersonal communication research. With the development of URT, researchers began to look to communication theories of gender and relational communication for theoretical and practical applications. Founded on the belief that communication theorists need to focus on context and the interpretation of information, the field of interpersonal communication research emerged with the development of URT, offering new perspectives on understanding relational communication strategies. This evolution in research was driven by changes in interpersonal communication research that led to a new way of thinking about effective communication practices.

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Historically, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field. Interpersonal communication is often associated with studies in linguistics, sociology, and social psychology. Prior to the 1850s, only a moderate amount of research fell under the category of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryan (2000) identified this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: "Practically since 1901, scholars have adopted communication as the central theme because they realized that it is a sophisticated and integrated science of human behavior." The 1800s marked the impact of an increasing interest in interpersonal study and the influence of personal data. These investigative patterns were not only the result of personal observations, but also a response to societal changes in mass communication technology and increased distributed media, shaping the understanding that communication could be interpreted through different lenses.
