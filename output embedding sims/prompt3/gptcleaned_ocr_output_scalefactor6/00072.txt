Defining Uncertainty

Research conducted under the umbrella of interpersonal communication initially focused on social influence, and small group practices. Theorists explored the role of behavior, performance, social judgment, and acceptance (Berger, 1975). Kurt Lewin, a pioneer of social psychology, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such giants as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the LSA and into the LSB, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Panelap, Relotz, and Berger, along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Gales, Hargadon, and Panzano. Berger (2006) states "these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal COM agenda over the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication continues to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into Interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. Throughout its history, interpersonal communication has been motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that contributes to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter aims to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is essential for understanding interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty
Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary for all areas of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1948) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there were high amounts of possible alternatives and the probabilities of their occurrence were relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of Uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of uncertainty reduction theory (URT). Berger and Calabrese (1975) adapted concepts from information theory as well as Heider (1958) research on attribution. Berger and Calabrese expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining it as the "degree of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 30). The greater the uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and consequences. During interaction: individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe the way they do. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlights this point when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of interpretations that a stranger can believe of potentially many ways." Uncertainty plays a vital role in relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit social relationships when examining areas of uncertainty which commonly lead to four divisions of communicative concerns remnants.
