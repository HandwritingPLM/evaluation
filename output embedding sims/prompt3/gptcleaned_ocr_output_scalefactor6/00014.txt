1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the label interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social facades, and reactance (Berger, 1986). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a coincidental role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Newinger, Hilder, Belief, and Howie. By the 1960s, research areas began shifting into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the latter part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Flanagan, Healey, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Courpesant, and Patterson. Berger (2005) stated: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication research agenda during the past two decades" (p. 406). Today, interpersonal communication mediated in faces an dyadic communication. Comprise inhibiting face-to-face interaction of communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been acknowledged that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter aims to focus on those theories that pioneered the presence of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication and is central to our understanding of interpersonal processes.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary for the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concern originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of Information Processing Theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty arises in a given situation when the decision-maker is in high demand of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal, Shannon and Weaver thus introduced the notion of uncertainty into communication of things, but their work aided in the development of LRT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from their investigation theories as well as Heider’s (1948) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975) introduced the concept of uncertainty into interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the “number of alternative ways in which each behavioral act might behave” (p. 10). The higher the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behavior and outcomes, creating a tension between individuals and promoting uncertainty. Individuals are faced with the problem of predicting behavior and occurrences, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1992) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: “uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say”. Uncertainty plays a significant role when entering social settings. High levels of uncertainty can adversely impact relationships and people. Uncertainty reduces the ability for effective communication and comprehension (Cited: Berger, 1986). Competent communicators likely need to develop relationships or can be too anxious to engage in social interactions. West and Farmer (2001) note that lower levels of uncertainty caused by neutral and nonverbal behavior leads to increased liking. This increased liking can lead to a better experience we will have in future interactions. When high uncertainty exists it becomes a problem, this may result in a lack of personal space and predictability can also be an issue. Heath and Bryan, 2000 state, “Too much neediness and predictability can hinder a collaboration”.
