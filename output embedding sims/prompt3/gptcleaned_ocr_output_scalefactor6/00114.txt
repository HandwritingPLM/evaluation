Meaning And Criteria

Needs and Gratifications

Uses and Practice

Katz's approach emphasizes motives and the perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) commented that different people can interpret the same communication message for vastly different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situations, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's ideas about what they can gain from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can establish their own motives and gratifications for using a certain media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1977) proposed a model of "media-gratification interactions" to classify four overlapping media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine, emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance: seeking information for security.

Another subdivision of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between basic needs: deficit vs. growth. He added three dimensions: "active" vs. "passive" initiation, "external" vs. "internal" goal orientation, and emotion stability of "growth" and "preservation" When charted. These factors lead to different types of tensions which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1 shows a structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motives (Guire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1972) developed 35 needs taken from social and psychological contexts of media and mediated communication.

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding.
2. Aesthetic needs, including pleasure, feelings of enjoyment.
3. Personal integrative needs, including self-assertion, status.
4. Social integrative needs, connecting and socializing with family and friends.
5. Tension release needs, including escape and relaxation.
