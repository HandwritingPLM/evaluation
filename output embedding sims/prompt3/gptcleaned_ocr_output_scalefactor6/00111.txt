Chapter 11: Uncertainty Reduction

Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese, and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-20th century, the concept of uncertainty has been a cornerstone for communication research and the development of communication theory. See Chapter 18 for a detailed overview of Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT), which involves processes that guide how individuals seek, share, perceive, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT), credited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), was recognized for addressing uncertainties in the study of communication. Through the application of URT, these scholars have contributed to the field of interpersonal communication by understanding the critical role that uncertainty plays in communication patterns, behavior, and outcomes (Heath & Bryant, 2000). The intricacies of uncertainty and the motivations underlying people's reliance on communication methods are crucial for navigating the complexities of interpersonal interactions. The fusion of interpersonal communication with a focus on uncertainty advances theoretical understanding and places communication at the core of interpersonal exchanges. Berger and Calabrese (1975) asserted that informed social communication can significantly impact interpersonal bonds and have been central to enhancing psychological theories as a foundational aspect. The research underpinning the theory and further expanded on by other researchers has underscored the emergence of interpersonal communication as a vital field of study.

The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as a fundamentally integral part of human interaction at its core, beyond mere verbal exchanges. Price (1982) posited that the early origins of communication can be traced back to the essence of interpersonal relationships. Heath and Hees (2000) noted the significance of interpersonal communication, identifying it as the genesis of the field of interpersonal communication research. Over time, a range of studies have explored the intricate connections between perception and reality, the effects of language and behavior on relationships, and the factors influencing relational dynamics. The evolving perspectives on relationships have underscored the importance of trust, reciprocity, and the belief that relationships can be enhanced through effective communication.
