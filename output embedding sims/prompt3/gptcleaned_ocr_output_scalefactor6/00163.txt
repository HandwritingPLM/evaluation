From a critical theory perspective, based on Marxist concepts, we see the issue of the separation of culture from social and traditions, giving rise to a culture industry that mass-produces and commodifies culture. In such context, culture becomes a tool for manipulation and control of the masses, serving the interests of those in power. 

 

Adorno believed that critical theory should explore and challenge the constraints imposed by industrial culture, advocating for a more autonomous and emancipated form of culture that is free from the profit-driven motives of the culture industry. He believed that by challenging the culture industry and promoting the importance of critical theory, society could break free from the oppression and conformism imposed by industrial culture. 

 

Adorno’s concept of the culture industry has had a lasting impact on critical theory, influencing the development of cultural studies and media theory. Adorno’s ideas have helped to shape a critical approach to culture, one that seeks to uncover the hidden mechanisms of control and manipulation that underlie industrial culture. Through his work, Adorno has inspired generations of scholars to engage critically with culture and media, pushing for a more emancipated and autonomous cultural landscape.
