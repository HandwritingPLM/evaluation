Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Cantril, Lasswell, and Bernays are valuable for a number of reasons. Building on the ideas of his predecessors, Cantril now acknowledges in his address the importance of the work of Lippmann and his colleagues had for more recent research and understanding the interaction of the public and the media. Through the work of Cantril and others, a comprehensive understanding of the media has been developed. The public has also been influenced by various media practitioners, particularly in relation to public opinion and their involvement in their lives. The theories presented in this paper have also shown how important it is to study the direct impact of media in society.

These theories, such as those discussed by Cantril, Lasswell, and Bernays, have the potential to greatly influence the understanding of the exchange of ideas and information in society. By studying the theories developed by these individuals, researchers can gain valuable insights into the behavior of the public and the ways in which society functions. While the theories of Lasswell were formed several decades ago, they are still relevant today and can help us understand the society that we live in.
