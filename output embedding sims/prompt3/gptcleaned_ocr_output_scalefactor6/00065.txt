i. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1. Needs and Gratifications

The interactions between media and individuals can vary greatly. Needs and gratifications differ among media users (Katz, 1973). In addition to media use, other factors, such as individuals' backgrounds including aspects like age, education, influence people's ideas about what they seek from media and how they gratify those needs. Thus, audience members are aware of and can satisfy their needs through various media content. Perse and Rubin (1989) proposed a model that links media use with psychological needs, including information, personal identity, integration, social interaction, and entertainment. 

Another perspective within the media and audience relationship was recognized by McQuail (1994), who developed a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. He added dimensions such as "internal" vs. "external," "active" vs. "pasive," "goal orientation," and "orientation ability to reach goals" and found that these factors would determine different types of media use (McQuail, 1983).

Gay research findings showed that media use varies based on the level of needs stimulation (McQuail, 1974). Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur (1976) developed a model that outlines the social and psychological functions of the mass media, identifying five types of needs:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding
2. Affective needs, including emotional responses, pleasure, and feelings
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, and status
4. Social integrative needs, including interaction with family and friends
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion

Similarly, Katz (1959) classified several common reasons for media use:

- Finding out about societal events and conditions in information environments, socially and at work
- Seeking advice on practical matters, opinions, and decision-making
- Satisfying curiosity and general interest
- Learning and self-education
- Gaining a sense of security through information
- Finding reinforcement for personal values
- Finding models of behavior
- Social interaction with family and friends through the media
- Getting relief from stress
