Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

The Uses and Gratifications approach is an influential paradigm that offers a conception of how people use media and certain media content. The core question of SUGT PRSES is "why do people use them for?" (McQuail, 1982). This approach suggests that people's needs influence what media they choose to consume, and what gratifications they seek from it. Unlike traditional perspectives that view audiences as passive receivers of information, the Uses and Gratifications approach regards audiences as active media users who select media based on their personal needs and respond to it accordingly, influenced by their social and psychological background. This approach also posits that media compete with other information sources to satisfy audience needs (Reitz et al., 1974). As traditional mass media and new media offer a wide range of platforms and content, the Uses and Gratifications approach is considered a valuable perspective for investigating why audiences prefer certain media over others. 

The approach emphasizes audiences' selection based on their reasons for using a particular media, as well as the gratifications they derive from it, aligning with their individual social and psychological requirements (Severin & Tankard, 1997). From a broader perspective of Communication Research, it provides a framework for understanding how media participants seek information or content, aligning with their needs and interests (Katz et al, 1974). Audience members incorporate content to fulfill their needs or satisfy their interests (Lowery & Nabi, 1998).
