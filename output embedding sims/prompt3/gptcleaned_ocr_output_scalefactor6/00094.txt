Needs and Gratifications

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows. They provide a framework for understanding the relationship between media and audiences:

1. The audience is considered an active, i.e., an important part of the mass media as patterns of media use are shaped by more or less definitive expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience.
2. In the mass communication process, much emphasis on linking needs and gratification and theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and behavior.
3. The main competition with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs carved by the communication conditions build a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption constantly varies.
4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - i.e., people are efficient enough to be able to report their needs and goals in particular cases or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal form.
5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience preferences are explored on their own terms. 

Additionally, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also contended that, although previous research on gratifications detected somewhat different preferences, goals, and motivations of people using the media, they did not address the connections between these gratifications. They instead came up with a model explaining different aspects regarding media use, influence, expectations, and sources, leading to different experiences and engaging in other activities, resulting in media production and other consequences, perhaps closely intersected areas. The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation for building an essential and quantifications approach. Since then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and expanded. The current status of needs and gratifications is all based on Katz's initial analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in an electronic information age where people have more options for media use. 

Needs and Gratifications

The needs and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of media users. As Katz (1972) pointed out, people use the media for very different purposes. The same media content may satisfy different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media; on the contrary, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users. 

External needs, social influences, and the individual's background, such as age, interests, and education, affect people's choices about the media and what content best meets their needs. Therefore, different individuals can have different needs and gratifications for using the media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (2002) proposed a model of "media-person selection" for analyzing media gratification.
