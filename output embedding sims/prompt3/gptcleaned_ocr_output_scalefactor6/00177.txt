1. Weeds and Gratifications

The weeds and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication message for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1984).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and what more 'effective gratifications' they want. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-personalities" that includes four important immediate gratifications: (1) Diversion - escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships - companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity - self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then, he added the dimension of "active versus passive" initiation, "external versus internal goal orientation, and parameter stability of "growth and preservation." When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1 shows the structuring of 16 panel paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 95 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into three categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;
2. Affective needs, including aesthetics, pleasure, and feelings;
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, and status;
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Concurrently, McGuire (1983) classified the following common reasons for media use:

- Finding out about recent events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society, and the world.
- Seeking advice on practical matters or making decisions.
- Satisfying curiosity and general interest.
- Learning or education.
- Gaining a sense of security through knowledge.
- Finding companionship or general validation.
- Finding models of behavior.
- Identifying with others or role models.
- Gaining insight into oneself.
