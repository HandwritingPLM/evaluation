The Lippmann-Lasswell Theory

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was analyzing propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda was actually being written by Lippmann himself.

Lasswell (1902-1978) posited a new approach to the study of propaganda, which was a multidisciplinary field involving social science, psychology, communication theory, political science, and economics. He emphasized the importance of context in the analysis of propaganda.

Lippmann's work has been instrumental in shaping the field of propaganda studies. He explored the impact of media on public opinion and the role of propaganda in shaping public discourse. Lippmann's work is still relevant today, as propaganda continues to play a significant role in shaping public opinion.
