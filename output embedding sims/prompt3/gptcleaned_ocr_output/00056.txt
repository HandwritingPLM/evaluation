Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to investigate the genesis of the culture industry as well as its reception, the concept can be traced logically, from its preconditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music but also to movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frankfurt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late 1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means to disseminate propaganda under fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as "On the Fetish Character in Music and the Regression in Listening" is, in effect, a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more optimistic essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." A primary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could now be heard over the radio and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu impossible.” While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by a photograph or film as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was essential for artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the authority of Platonic order from the top—the original or Idea—to down of layers of imitations; to Adorno, mass production was not ion of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school was that of Adorno. In 19 who had succeeded in establishing a relationship for the Institute of Social Research that enabled the Institute to continue working in New York, obtained a position for Ado Research Project, Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other colleagues, applied for the position, although he later claimed not to know what a radio director was. Lazarus looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert, and wrote for the Project’s journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an s ephemeral performance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious hi es. While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project, Adorno looked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.
