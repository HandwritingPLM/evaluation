Introduction to “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the Culture Industry as well as its reception, the concept can be examined chronologically from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of Genesis of “The Culture Industry” originated in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno became, in effect, Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin’s death, “it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jäger, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began operating there. The Nazis’ rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jürgen Habermas would later note, the fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical experiences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frankfurt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late 1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as ‘On the Fetish Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin’s optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.”

The problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works are heard over the radio and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The aura of the original artwork was considered as the emancipation from the essential of the artistic authenticity. Adorno, in contrast to Benjamin, believed that the aura of the original artwork was the essential aspect. The general attitude of the Frankfurt School towards production was that of “Adorno’s solution was that enabled the Institute to continue working in a relationship with Columbia University run by Paul Lazarsfeld. The Institute of Social ise Princeton Radio Research Project, New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Institute, run by Paul Lazarsfeld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain, never integrated into the British academic mainstream. Adorno began with working on a manuscript on Husserl, although he looked forward to joining his Frankfurt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late 1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture.
