were published without their creators' permission in 1949. Horkheimer and The Institute came to Frankfurt to open in its new premises. Horkheimer became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. The book Television and the Public Sphere discussed the transformation of modern culture into a medium of unprecedented control (Adorno, 2005, p. 16).

Marcuse's One-Dimensional Man put forth an analysis of late capitalist society, highlighting social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society, aiming to integrate individuals into mass society. Capitalist production led to repressive affluence that kept society satisfied. Marcuse did not separate culture or mass media from society as a whole, focusing on the administration of individuals who have been manipulated to maintain social control.

The question arises of breaking the cycle of perpetuating ideology that oppresses individuals. It is challenging to envision a resolution to this dilemma and to develop opposition to the dominant ideology. Marcuse's analysis did not advocate for a leftist revival, as he was more a philosopher than an activist. The translation of theory into practice remains a challenge for many scholars (Chambers, 2004, p. 226). The authors continued publishing until 1969, despite individual dissemination of their work without permission from Horkheimer.
