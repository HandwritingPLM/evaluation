I, GENESIS OF “THE CULTURE INDUSTRY”

Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the examined chronologically, from the idea of the culture industry as well as the culture industry grew its pre-conditions, through its generations out of a concern with culture, is developed to its subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry is ultimately generated in opposition not to the mechanical re- grows out of a push to popular music, but was introduced to a number of historical contingencies. Having been introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and their relationship developed a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno was Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin’s death “it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on Adorno’s thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi party. Adorno had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began operating there. Adorno was in effect shocked by the departure from Germany, which not only meant that Adorno lost his job and relocated, but also affected his philosophical thought. As labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist experiences influencing the development of critical theory. Adorno was at Oxford from 1933 to 1938, where he worked as an outsider, never integrating into the British academic circle, unlike his Frankfurt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime immigrated. In the 1930s Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda seeped into entertainment increased during the 1930s, Benjamin and Adorno seemed to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist regimes. Adorno’s "Character in Music and the Primal Scene" is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin’s more optimistic Age of Mechanical Reproduction." The primary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of symphonic music, pseudo-symphonic renditions could now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together with sports and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu impossible.” (Agan, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film as the shedding of hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the essence of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the authority of Platonic order from the top - the original or Idea - to down of layers of imitations; to Adorno, mass production was nothing but the destruction of authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school was that of Adorno. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeded in establishing a relationship for the Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in New York, obtained a position project, run by Paul Lazarsfeld for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was. For his part, looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music. Adorno wrote for the Project’s journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live performance; he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious music. While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project Adorno upon how culture had become commercialized in the United States.
