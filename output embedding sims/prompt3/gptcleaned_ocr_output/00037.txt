In the later part of the decade, Oloff and Berger became popular. While Computerized Grammar Checkers (CGS) likely owe an adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and others, their research has helped shape the interpersonal communication field (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004, p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication within relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically examines maintenance and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that uncertainty reduction motivates this research (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).

Since the 1970s, uncertainty has been identified as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of communication as a whole. This chapter aims to focus on pioneering research of uncertainty reduction in interpersonal communication and its importance to understanding interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct in the study of communication, it would be beneficial to understand when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there were a high number of possible alternatives and the probability of their occurrence was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, which also contributed to the development of Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT). Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from information theorists and Heider (1958) research in attribution. They expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the "number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The higher the level of uncertainty in a situation, the less likely individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences.

During interactions, individuals are faced with predicting present and past behaviors, as well as explaining why partners behave or believe in a certain way. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: "Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say." Uncertainty plays a significant role in examining relationships, as high levels of uncertainty can impede relational development. It can cause stress and anxiety, leading to lower levels of communicator competence (West & Turner, 2000). Incompetent communicators may struggle to develop relationships or may be too anxious during interpersonal interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty can lead to more nonverbal behavior and increased unpredictability with the goal of reducing uncertainty.

When high uncertainty exists, individuals often seek to reduce it, as high levels of certainty and predictability can also inhibit a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: "Too much certainty and predictability can deaden a relationship."
