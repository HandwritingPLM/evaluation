The needs served by Mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption certainly varies.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - i.e., people are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous research on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people to the media, they did not address the connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifications research concern with the following aspects: "the social and the psychological origins of needs which generate expectations of the mass media or other sources which lead to differential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in need gratification and other consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones" (Katz et al., 1974b, p. 20). The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and gratifications is still based on Katz’s first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in such an electronic information age when people have more options for media use.
