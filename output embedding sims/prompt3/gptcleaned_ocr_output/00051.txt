In a chapter edited by Katz and Blumler, uses and gratifications are interpreted as “a social
expectation that different people have distinct needs to be met by different media” (Katz
1992). In this chapter examination of the original uses and gratifications as earlier proposed by

thematical (Blumler & Katz, 1974). He explored the notion that people use the media to their
benefit. The uses and gratifications research demonstrates that the mass media serve as a means
by which individuals can connect or disconnect themselves with others, and suggests that individuals
tend to shape the media to fit their needs rather than being overpowered by it. As Katz, Gurevitch,
and Haas (1973) illustrate, people have active roles in choosing which media to consume based on
their needs and preferences.

Katz had a mentor at Columbia University, Paul Lazarsfeld, who was a significant figure in
gratifications research. Their collaborative work led to important developments linking gratifications
with the functional theory model. Katz later introduced the uses and gratifications approach by
proposing that individuals utilize media to fulfill their specific needs. In the study conducted by
Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), known as uses and gratifications research, they observed that
individuals manipulate the media to serve their personal needs in their interactions with others.

In partnership with Jay G. Blumler, Katz co-authored a book in 1974 titled The Uses of Mass
Communication. In this book, they adopted a humanistic perspective in analyzing how media
consumers select sources that best meet their needs. Their research revealed that media users are
actively involved in selecting and utilizing media to fulfill their requirements, ultimately shaping
the functions of media in society and for individuals (Blumler & Katz, 1974).
