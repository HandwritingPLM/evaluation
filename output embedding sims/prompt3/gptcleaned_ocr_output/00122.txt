Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding of the public opinion (Lasswell, 1948) and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing and increasing public opinion are main points of focus. Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase, "It is less the use of facts than anything else that distinguishes the advocates of one set of social arrangements from their opponents." In contrast to Lippmann's view of the public as easily manipulatable, Bernays cautions against this. He claims that the public opinion can't be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66), emphasizing that in influencing the public, a business must make communication between itself and the public amicable and mutually beneficial. Bernays' theories also represent a different view of public relations as a tool that can be used by both the public and the persuader. The public relations practitioner helps the client adjust to the contemporary situation or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). While Bernays acknowledges the power of society, he also believes in the manipulative capabilities of public relations to some extent.

Bernays (1952) discusses the benefits of public relations, stating that it helps citizens understand the society they are part of, know and evaluate others' viewpoints, exert leadership in modifying conditions, evaluate others' efforts, and suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of the public remains possible, it is not in blatant ignorance of public opinion. The theories of Lippmann and Ellul often disagreed on this point.

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays still hold importance for a variety of reasons. Lippmann's work paved the way for understanding how the media can influence the public, leading to subsequent research by Iyengar, Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw developing a more comprehensive understanding of media functions like agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and their effects on audiences. These theories have influenced research on both direct effects and limited effects of media, with some theorists focusing on the direct effects model, while others, like Lippmann, suggesting that media may influence not just what is thought about but also what is not thought about. This diversity of perspectives on media influence from limited effects to direct effects is crucial for understanding the role of the media in shaping public opinion. The research of these scholars is vital for understanding the media and its impact on public opinion in contemporary society.
