Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure in linguistics. Barthes applied the systematic theory to the latter's parole. Langue is the system of communication, indifferent to the material elements of the signs, whereas parole covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1967, p. 15).

Saussure invented the linguistic system within the social dimension. The structural level consists of conventions or values shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. Parole, on the other hand, is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. A language is, therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract which one must accept if one wishes to communicate. It resists modifications from a single individual and is a social institution. In contrast to language which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the language code to express personal thoughts. Speech corresponds to an individual act because it is essentially a combinative activity and not a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes language into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning while the form is the signifier, the external part of language. The correspondence between the concept/meaning and the external form is in the arbitrary relation rather than the destined relation. Meaning is produced through the selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g. synonyms), organized into a signifying system (Barker, 2002, p. 29).

As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic is a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. The selection within the same paradigmatic is regulated by the consensus of the linguistic community. Saussure argues that signs do not make sense by reference to entities in themselves but rather by reference to each other. Meaning is not fixed, but generated through the relations between signs (Barker, 2002, p. 29).
