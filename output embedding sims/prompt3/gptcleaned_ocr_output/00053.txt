Needs and Gratifications

Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 stated five basic assumptions in a study on the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is active and considered an important part of mass media use. It is assumed to be goal-oriented, with patterns of media use shaped by expectations of what different content offers the audience.

2. In the mass communication process, initiative in connecting need gratification and media choice rests with the audience. This limits theorizing about a direct impact of media content on attitudes and behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. Mass communication serves a segment of human needs, with varying degrees of satisfaction through media consumption.

4. Methodologically, individual audience members can provide data on their goals for media use. People are self-aware enough to report their interests and motives or recognize them when presented in a familiar verbal manner.

5. Cultural judgments about mass communication significance should be suspended while exploring audience orientations on their own terms (p. 15-17).

Additionally, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch noted that previous research on gratifications identified diverse attractors on the media but did not address the links between these gratifications. They suggested that uses and gratifications research focus on the social and psychological origins of needs, expectations, media or other sources, exposure, need gratification, and unintended consequences. (Katz et al., 1974b, p. 20).

The uses and gratifications approach highlights audience motives and perceived needs. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different individuals can use the same communication message for varied purposes, with media content satisfying different needs for different people. There are multiple reasons for media use, as diverse as the users themselves (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Individuals' basic needs, social context, background, and education influence their ideas about media use and which media best meet their needs. Audience members are conscious of their motives and gratifications for using different media. Quail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of 'four important media gratifications "media-person interactions".'
