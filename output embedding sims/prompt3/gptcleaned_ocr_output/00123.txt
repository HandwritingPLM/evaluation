1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1. Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motivation: Basic human needs and the self-perceived needs of audience members drive media usage for various purposes. The same need may be fulfilled in different ways by individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for media use as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974). Social situations, an individual's environment, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and values, shape people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. In this sense, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person interaction" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or stress; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotional stability of "growth" and "preservation." When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;

2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status;

4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Congruously, McQuail's (1983) classification of the following common reasons for media use:

finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society and the world
seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision choice
satisfying curiosity and general interest
education
maturity through knowledge
learning; self-growth
gaining a sense of security
finding reinforcement for personal values and behavior
finding models or others (in the media)
identifying with valued others
gaining insight into oneself
