As one of the structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics theory. The linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system, and the variation. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized area of communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which conveys it, while speech (parole) covers the purely individual aspect (Barthes, 1967, p. 13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic ideas as a linguistic system within the social dimension. Langue is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. It is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the influence of language. 

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract that one must accept in its entirety to communicate. It resists modifications from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language to express personal thoughts. Speech corresponds to an individual act and not pure creation. 

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through form, known as the signifier. The signifier is the external part of language. The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form operates in an arbitrary relation. Saussure argues that meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic. Signs are understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs within a particular context.
