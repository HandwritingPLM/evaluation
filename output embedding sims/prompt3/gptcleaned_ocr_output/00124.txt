Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1931. He earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creates applications of diffusion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from the University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An innovation is an idea, practice, or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels" (p. 409). That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass communication, people can get information on an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell (1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E (sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, "this S-M-C-R-E communication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion" (p. 19). Specifically, (1) the sender can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) the message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally (5) the effects can be an individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, the 'Time' variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), the time variable is involved in diffusion in (1) the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation's rate of adoption. Most innovations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables that influence how and why users and audiences adopt a new information medium, such as the Internet. According to the evolution of media technology, the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Additionally, critical mass becomes an important factor in adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to be efficient. That is, the more people use, the more people benefit. In this sense, diffusion theory not only applies to practical things but can also be related to the digital divide.

In the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (the deliberate majority), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional).
The degree to which an individual is relative earlier in adopting new ideas than other members of his social system (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure 1 shows the relationships between types of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories form a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped.

Different innovations have their own different rates.

In the process of innovation-decisions, Rogers (1991) Knowledge + or - interpersonal influences are important even though in the term as "selective exposure or favorable or unfavorable judgments." 
As noted above, different types of innovations, the adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed corn, can fiture 2. Shapes of curves of diffusions for innovations Source: english/case/con-

There are five stages:

1. Knowledge + or - (interpersonal influences are important even though in this term as "selective exposure or favorable or unfavorable judgments")
2. Attitudes + or - (people have a positive or negative attitude toward innovations)
3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation
4. Implementation (regular or standard practice)
5. Confirmation (comparing and evaluating)
