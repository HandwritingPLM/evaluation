1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

The basic assumptions of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 are as follows:

1. In the relationship between media and audiences, they provide a framework for understanding the core.

2. An important aspect of mass media use is shaped by the audience's expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer.

3. The audience is seen as active and goal-oriented, with definite expectations of certain content.

4. Much of the initiative in linking need gratification and media choice lies with the audience member, limiting straight-line effects of media content on attitudes and behavior.

5. Media competes with other sources of need satisfaction, meeting only a segment of human needs.

6. The goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves.

7. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored.

Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also noted that previous research on gratifications focused on diverse gratifications without addressing the connections between them. They proposed that uses and gratifications research considers the social and psychological origins of needs, which generate expectations of mass media, leading to differential exposure and need gratification. This theoretical foundation laid the groundwork for future research.

The current status of needs and gratifications is still based on Katz's initial analysis, particularly in the context of new media forms in the electronic information age.

The uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and purposes behind media use, recognizing that different users have different needs. Audience members are aware of their motivations for using different media. Basic needs, social situations, and individual backgrounds influence what people seek from media. Audience members are diverse in their media uses, reflecting their unique experiences, interests, and interactions.
