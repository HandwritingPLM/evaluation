were published without their permission in 1949 themselves. Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing themselves from the Institute. In the 1940s, the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and in the late 1950s they returned to Germany. The Institut f√ºr Sozialforschung in Frankfurt opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer resumed his teaching at the University of Frankfurt. In 1954, Adorno published an essay looking at Television that was the result of collaboration with the Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of G. Horkheimer. He warned against the rigid institutionalization of modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed potential (Rogers, 1994, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s where the implications of mass culture were discussed. At least one observer found that Adorno, considered the leading cultural theorist of his day, did not take part in cultural development (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless, on occasion, attempt to reshape his thoughts on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film, Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 531).

2. One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving ideological ends, for Marcuse, social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control. Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination (Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno 

viewed society allowed for no opposition to the dominant ideologies. repressed individuals who have made their mutilation prevalent by accepting superficial satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scale - liberate themselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thinkable that the? (Marcuse 1991, p. 951).
