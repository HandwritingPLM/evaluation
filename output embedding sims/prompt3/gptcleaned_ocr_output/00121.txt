It is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sociology. These theories have been illuminated by valuable ideas as well as exploring untapped fields in higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of media effects research, the uses and gratifications approach is suggested to have originally stemmed from a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). Functional theory on communication, to some extent, agrees with media's effects on people. For example, a model often used in this theory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that "the mass media have a direct, immediate, and influential effect upon audiences by 'injecting' information into the consciousness of the masses" (Watson & Hill 1997, p. 105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift occurred which rediscovered the relationship between media and people, leading to the establishment of the uses and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programs, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well as daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.). In these studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1974). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice, support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering information, newspapers were also discovered to be important in giving readers a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) labeled them with the term "gratifications."

The uses and gratifications approach became prevalent from the late 1950s to the 1970s as television grew. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed during that era. Among the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz served both as a sociologist and a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. Over the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work on broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication from the 1970s to 1990s (UPENN, 2001). In 1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania and also directed its experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor at Columbia University was Paul Lazarsfeld, one of the pioneers of gratifications research. Their collaborative work produced important insights connecting the concept of gratifications with the functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced the uses and gratification approach when he proposed that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), a subject known as uses and gratifications research was explored. They viewed the mass media as a means by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people use the media to their needs more readily than the media overpowers them (Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas, 1973).

Together with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanistic approach to looking at media use. They suggested that media users seek out the medium source that best fulfills their needs and have alternative choices to satisfy them (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also found that media served functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment, and cultural transmission for both society and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
