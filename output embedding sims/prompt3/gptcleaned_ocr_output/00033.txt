for using the media as there are media etc. Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background such as

education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and wi

interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Personal identity: self-reference; rela-

tion seeking. Problems; emotional release;

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: "active" versus "passive" initiation, "external" versus "internal" goal orientation, and emotional stability of "

"growth" and "preservation." When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

Important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or

companionship; social utility; (3) Personal

es; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding;

Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

2. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status;

3. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and

4. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.
