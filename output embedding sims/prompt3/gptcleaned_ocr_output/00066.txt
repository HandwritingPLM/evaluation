Rogers (1948) presented a model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E (sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, "this S-M-C-R-E model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion" where inventors or opinion leaders, sender, interpersonal or mass communication channel, message or product, and the effects can be individual's receiver can be members of a social system, and finally, time is a very important factor. According to Rogers, there are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process according to innovativeness: Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards.

1. Knowledge + OF (selective exposure OF awareness of news)
