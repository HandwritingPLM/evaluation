It is well accepted that communication ties sociology over the past two decades. The two disciplines, research.

The exploration of gratifications through empirical studies, such as daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, etc.). Studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice, support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948); rather than just offering information, newspapers were also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

The uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television had grown. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University. In the late 1960s, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with the introduction of television broadcasting in Israel. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication from 1970 till 1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its doctoral study.

Among the field, who is one of the pioneers of gratifications research. He uses and gratification approach when he came up with the study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), a subject by which individuals connect or disconnect surveillance, journalists and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974). 

In these studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium itself (Katz et al., 1974b).
