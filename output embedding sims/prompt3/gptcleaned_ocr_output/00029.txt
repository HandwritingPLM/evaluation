1. EARLY INFLUENCES

Uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics. He had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, Festinger initially worked at the University of Rochester, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, Festinger continued his work at Stanford University and the New School for Social Research. Festinger's work on the need for social comparison can be related to uncertainty, as Berger and Calabrese (1975) stated, "Festinger has suggested that persons seek out others who are proximate and experiencing a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation" (p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. His legacy is significant and can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in Festinger, 1980) stated, "It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since" (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz. During his time in Europe, Heider worked with renowned psychologists such as Wolfgang KÃ¶hler, Max Wertheimer, and Kurt Lewin. Heider acknowledged Lewin as a significant influence, stating, "I want to pay tribute to Lewin's stimulating influence, which has affected much of my thinking and is still strong even in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work" (Heider, 1958, p. vii). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later at the University of Kansas, where he spent the rest of his career (Ash, 2000).
