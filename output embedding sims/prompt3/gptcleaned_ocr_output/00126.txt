Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange, in which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty, is a basic human function. Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that reducing uncertainty was a central motive in interpersonal communication by examining the acquisition of information. 

Through the development of URT, these scholars examined the motivations with which to reduce uncertainty which was a key focus in the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Calabrese (1975) note: "One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication was the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty" (p. 153). The study of information is basic to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT placed a significant relationship in uncertainty at the central core of communication.

Berger and Calabrese (1975) have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal communication process, marking the emergence of URT. Communication researchers of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches. They tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points. The research underlying the theories began to look to other contemporaries with the development rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social sciences.

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field most often linked to studies into language, social cognition, and social psychology. Interpersonal communication is a central term because scholars adopted communication as they wanted to study it as a significant and unique aspect of human behavior.

Research in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, finding that psychiatric problems were not only a result of self problems but a result of relational problems as well. Research trends in humanistic psychology and existentialism inspired the idea that relationships could be improved through effective means.
