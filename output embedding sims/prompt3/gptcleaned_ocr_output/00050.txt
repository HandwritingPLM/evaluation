Needs and Gratifications

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows:

- They Provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:
- The audience is conceived as active, viewed as being goal-oriented, with definite expectations of what media should provide for each member.
- An important part of mass media use is that patterns of media use are shaped by more or less certain kinds of content have to offer the audience.
- In the mass communication process, much media choice lies with the audience, theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and behaviors.
- The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs, and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumption certainly varies.
- Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves - i.e., people are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.
- Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous research on gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people to the media, they did not address the connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifications research concern with the following aspects: the social and psychological origins of needs, which generate expectations of the mass media or other sources which lead to differential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in need gratification and perceived consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones (Katz et al., 1974b, p. 20). The studies of his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications area; since then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The analysis of gratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as new forms have emerged in such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use.

This emphasizes motives and self-perceived needs of audience members. People can use the same communication messages for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different people, even in the same media users. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

The gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience members. People can use the same communication messages for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different people, even in the same media users. Contrarily, there are as many reasons for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people's interests. That is, audience members are selective on media. McQuail, Blumler, and others sought to classify four important media gratifications: situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, can state their own motives and gratifications. They proposed a model of "media-person."
