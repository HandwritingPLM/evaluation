1. Early Influences

Uncertainty

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication. The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, he initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin's death, he worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and furthered Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential in the emerging field of interpersonal communication and in the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) which attempted to explain cognitive dissonance and social comparison processes. Cognitive Dissonance theory explores how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual's attitudes, as seen in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups and how relationships occur among individuals when the cognitions in question have no effect on one another. Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dissonance (West & Turner, 2000). Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to others to establish their own abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual seeks feedback from others to evaluate their performance and generally seeks the opinions of others who are similar to them (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese described conformity pressures and stated that persons seek out similar information to reduce uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of their behavior in a particular situation. Festinger received the Distinguished Senior Scientist award from the American Psychological Association for his significant contributions to social science research.

Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Vienna, studying under the supervision of Max Wertheimer and later worked with prominent psychologists such as Wolfgang Kohler. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin's guiding influence, which stimulated his work and contributed to Lewin's theories. Heider's influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson noted, "Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of cognitive dissonance, but it has not been the same since" (p. 3).
