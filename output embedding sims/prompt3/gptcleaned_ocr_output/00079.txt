1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning theories, dissonance, balance, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the 1970s and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Verderber emerged, along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon and Perez. Berger (2005) states: "these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal communication agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our understanding of interpersonal processes.

1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated and how it has been defined and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal. Shannon and Weaver also contributed to the development of information theorists, as well as Heider (1958) in research in attribution, expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal contexts: the "number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave in a situation, the smaller that exists in a situation, the smaller level of uncertainty there is and occurrences. During interactions, individuals are faced with the challenge of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac (1982) further expanded on this process when they stated that a stranger "is not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also of explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do" (p. 100).

The greater the level of uncertainty, the harder the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors. Individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also of explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this construct. Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things a person can believe or potentially say in relationships. High levels of uncertainty can cause stress and anxiety which can lead to low levels of satisfaction, emotional closeness, and relational development. Uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development, which can lead to low levels of trust (West & Turner, 2000). Incompetent communicators may not be able to engage in initial interactions, develop relationships, or may be too anxious to communicate effectively. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty can lead to increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking between interactants. Increased predictability within a relationship can help to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions, but it can be difficult to reach this goal. In interpersonal interactions, individuals are expected to interpret social cues in order to predict behaviors. West and Turner (2000) assert that this will lead to the ability to predict and explain what will occur in the future. When high uncertainty exists in an interaction, individuals are rational that this will lead to the ability to predict and explain what will occur in the future. Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty and predictability can also inhibit a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) state that too much certainty and predictability can deaden a relationship. Uncertainty and predictability can lead to a balance of certainty and predictability can lead to a balance of certainty and predictability which can dannsfn rplnfir artnrtia ;;^rTindrTflincr.
