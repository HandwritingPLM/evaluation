THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION
Commercialization of culture in the United States and Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something beyond anything he had seen in Europe. Adorno was later to allude to his experience with an advertising project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical findings and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political research (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to the idea of the culture industry. Because of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University, Adorno, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until November 1941. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Bertolt Brecht, Hans Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred DÃ¶blin, and others. Some of which found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood movies must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as late capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Hollywood in the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization (Horkheimer and Adorno, 1995, p. 142). Examples of this were the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton analysis, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 108). This ensured that there would not be any real change to the system, no new ideas would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 108), and Adorno cited Orson Welles and other institutions. The culture industry was an opposing force to the culture industry, suppressing that the dominant system of social control. Adorno specifically defines avant-garde music as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 101). It was not high art that Adorno was enterta taicement or amusement, convenience, or even consumption for its own sake in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
