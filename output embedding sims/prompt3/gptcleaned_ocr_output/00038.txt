INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

1. THE CULTURE

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 142). Examples of this - not specified by Adorno - were the Hollywood production system and the CBS radio network associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Melodies and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the status quo, and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, pp. 106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffective (Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry is a tool of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose is merely coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002).

Preconditions such as Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the connection of several members to the Hollywood film industry are all important to an understanding of his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

Adorno had previously been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, as opposed to popular culture. The Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of the high art, but modernism. Although he provides the idea of presenting as an alternative to the culture industry, Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis. Instead, he sees a posing force to the culture industry, utilizing capacities for mass consumption for entertainment.

Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002).
