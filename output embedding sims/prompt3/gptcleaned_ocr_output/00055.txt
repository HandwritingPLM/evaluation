Like many scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels: the structured system of language, called langue, and the individual speaking components, known as speech (parole). Language, or langue, consists of conventions necessary for communication and is indifferent to the variations of speech, which is considered purely individual (Barthes, 1967, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structural level, langue, involves the social conventions shared within a society, representing stability and standardization. In contrast, parole, or speech, is flexible and expresses individual expression but remains influenced by shared conventions, the structure. 

Saussure divides the language system into two components: langue and parole. Langue represents the systematic system of language, while parole demonstrates the variation. Langue is the standardized set of material signals that compose language, while parole represents the individual acts of selection and actualization. Speech is considered an individual act of selection and expression, distinct from the institution and system of language. The speaking subject utilizes the language system to express personal thoughts, highlighting speech as a combinative activity rather than a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

During the structural analysis, Saussure delves into the signifying system of language, focusing on linguistic signs or signifiers. For example, the word "dog" signifies the concept of an animal, demonstrating the arbitrary nature of the signifier-signified relationship (Saussure, 1959). Saussure argues that language does not reflect pre-existing realities but constructs meaning through the relations between signs. The syntagmatic relation involves the combination of signs along two axes to form a signifying system with its own order and selection rules. The paradigmatic relation, on the other hand, shows how signs can be replaced with others within the linguistic community through a process of selection and combination (Barker, 2002, p. 29).
