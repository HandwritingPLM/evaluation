1. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking ¢ mpirical analysis.

In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda: conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is known for the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis is defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into specific categories in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication," Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience’s opinion, and the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to achieve the goal of understanding the stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content to audience" (p. 74).

Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, he defines propaganda as, a consistent enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the public.
