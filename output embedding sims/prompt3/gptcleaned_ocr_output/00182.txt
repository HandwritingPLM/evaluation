1. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists
1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harald Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be defined as, "the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication," Rogers adds that content analysis should take into account the frequency with which a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence runs from a source that runs from control to content and from content to audience. His method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell's (1953) early definition of communication which stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 84). Content analysis was essentially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them, and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann's theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Edward Bernays were examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion, Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was defining propaganda as, "a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a public to an enterprise, idea, or group" (p. 25) in order to decide what is beneficial or harmful to the public. Bernays felt that this may not always be beneficial to society's functioning as "societies are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of... Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together in a society" (p. 9).

Bernays believed that public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is essential. He focused much of his work in the field of public relations. "Public relations is the attempts by information, persuasion, and adjustment to engineer public support (or opposition) to agenda of various groups in society, particularly, Bernays (1955) lays out a detailed explanation on public relations campaign. Bernays states that the key to a successful public relations campaign is gathering information and developing a public relations campaign to move away from more passive strategies represent a step forward for mass communication. They move away from quantifications of "hit-or-miss propaganda," and move toward a types of communication channels.
