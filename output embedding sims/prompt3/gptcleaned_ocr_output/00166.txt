1. The culture industry: Enlightenment as mass deception

1. Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in Europe. The closest thing in the United States was something with no correlative in Adornoâ€™s experience to the division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research project as being indistinguishable from political propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that they did not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the project would eventually motivate him to further develop the idea of the culture industry. Because of the relationship between the Princeton Radio Research and Columbia University, Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the US.
In November 1941, when Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Bertolt Brecht, and others. The fact that Adorno found work in the Hollywood movie industry must have had some influence on developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany. Adornos interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industry, are all important to an understanding of his concern for the idea of the culture industry.
For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize and intentionally produce. This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford was implemented in the cultural sphere. Examples of this, not specified by Adorno, were the Hollywood film industry and the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies and hit songs were based on formulas and the form was meant to supplant mechanical reproduction ensured that there would be no opposition system. The culture industry allowed for innovation to be co-opted ultimately rendering it as an example of the very thing it sought to oppose, making it part of the system.
Adorno specifically was presenting an alternative to the dominant system of the culture industry, although he recognized the role of high art as being a defense against the culture industry. Adorno notes in passing that the dominant system provides mass consumption for entertainment or amusement and utilized capacity for change in his essays on music and radio, an apparent challenge to the Culture Industry as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture. Adorno defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry and the freedom to be ultimately defines the avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry.
