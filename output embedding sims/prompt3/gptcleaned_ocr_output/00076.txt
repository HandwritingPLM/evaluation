Like many other structuralist scholars, Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates predominantly between speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter are parole. Langue consists of conventions necessary for communication, indifferent to the material used, whereas speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 1967, pp.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within a social dimension. The structure langue is the social convention or value shared through a society that is stabilized and shared. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it represents the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure, a social institution, and a system of values. It is essentially, the social part of a contract one must accept in its entirety, a system of contractual values that is personal and consequently a social institution. Speech is essentially a system of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing personal thought. It is because speech is a personal and individual act and not a pure creation (Barthes, pp. 14-15).

 A language is therefore essentially a creation. Barthes distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signifier and the signified. The signified is situated through the form signifier, which is expressed through the form, an external part of language. For example, both the word and the actual animal "dog" Here, the actual form contains the word sign to be signified and represented by signified and image respectively.

 Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure designates the signifier, the signified, and the form expressing the signified propose to represent the signified and the word. The form is called the signifier. The signified is the concept in question becomes the meaning. Saussure argues that language does not designate the whole but the form that separates concept and meaning. The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not inevitable. It is not the only internal relation but the difference. Therefore, the two function as parts that separate from each other, establishing the whole - Saussure argues that "language does not designate the whole " (ed., p. 37). The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not inevitable; it is not an established internal relation but a difference. 

Saussure argues that "language does not designate the whole", it is not the whole preexisting and external reality of objects but constructs meaning from a series of conceptual and phonic differencesâ€™. According to Saussure, "meaning is created by the organization and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (a series of synonyms) organized into a signifying system" (Barker, 2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs and the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic signifies a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of the linguistic community members. For example, let's consider the following sentence "I went to a theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is established through the linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as theater, my, and girlfriend, can be substituted by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She went to a restaurant with her mom." Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are only operated when they are related to each other. Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each other. Thus, language is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs. It is central to Saussure that a red is meaningful in relation to the differences between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence that generates meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context (Barker, 2002, p. 28).
