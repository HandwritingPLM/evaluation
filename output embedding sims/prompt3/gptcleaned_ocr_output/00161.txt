Rogers (1995) diffusion refers to “the communicate through certain channels over time among the is an idea, practice or adoptee 3the members of a social system. An Innovation is wed by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication. That is, by sharing communication channels.

According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in the innovation-decision process; innovativeness; an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most innovations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables that influence how and why users and audiences adopt a new medium, such as the Internet.

According to the evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the the unit of analysis.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovators (venturesome), Early Adopters (respectable), Early Majority (Deliberate), Late Majority (skeptical), and Laggards (tradition, 195, PP: 183-185). Rogers defined this term as “the degree to which an individual is earlier in adopting new ideas than other members of his social system” (Rogers, we osntions.

Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in adoption of new media because new media and thus are required by many users to gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, people get benefits. In this sense, diffusion theory not only can apply to practical things, also related to the digital divide.
