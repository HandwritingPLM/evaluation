1. Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing public opinions (Bernays, 1955, p.22) is essential. Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase "the engineering of consent." He said, "Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and propaganda" (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays' theories also present a different view of the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, "The public is not an amorphous mass which can be willed or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in "Public Relations" (1952). Rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p.9). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, "To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others and to persuade or suggest courses of action" (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not in such ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree on this point.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that recent research is meant to help understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the work of Iyengar and Kinder, White Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding has been made aware of various media functions such as agenda-setting, gatekeeping and priming, and the potential effects that these techniques can have on their audiences.

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects media models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby the media could directly influence the thoughts of the masses. Meanwhile, others like Lippmann and McCombs and Shaw also noted that the media might not be influencing only thoughts, but may also be influencing what is thought about. It was this area of the limited effects of the media that resulted in propaganda theorists such as Lippmann, as well as McCombs and Shaw, furthering the understanding of the media.

While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the manipulation of the public and the formation of public opinion. Starting point for future research on the importance of the manipulation of the public has been very important to society that surrounds us today. 

Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in this paper has shown very important in understanding the public opinion.
