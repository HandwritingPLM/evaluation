Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure stressing that language operates on two levels, the systematic and the individual. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized code of communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which composes it. It covers the purely social part of language (Barthes, 1967). It is the linguistic system within the social dimension. The structural level involves conventions or values shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. Contrarily, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It resists modifications from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of language to express personal thought. Speech is a combinative activity that corresponds to an individual act and not pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, the external part of language. For instance, both the word "dog" in English and in Korean are external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. Saussure (1959) explains "I propose to retain the word sign (signe) to designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifi√©) and signifier (signifiant); the last two terms indicate the opposition separating them from each other and from the whole" (p. 37). The correspondence between concept/meaning and external form is not a destined relation but rather arbitrary. It is the difference between signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that "language constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences". Meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g., a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system (Saussure, 2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting signs within the paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of the linguistic community.

For example, in the sentence "[A person] went to a theater with [another person]," this sentence is established through the combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as the theater, my, and girlfriend can be replaced with others, like "She went to a restaurant with her mother." Barthes tells us that signs generate meaning by reference to each other, operating through relational conventions organized by the relations between signs (Barthes, 1967). This aligns with Saussure's argument that red is meaningful in relation to the difference between green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates meaning within a text, through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
