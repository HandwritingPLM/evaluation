1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Needs and Gratifications

The self-perceived needs of audience members. People can use the same communication message for different
reasons.

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and members. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different
users use the same media content may gratify different individuals. There is not only one way that people use media. Contrarily, there are reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situations, and the individual’s background, such as experience, interests, and education, affect people’s ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal identity: self-reference; reality exploration; value reinforcement; and (4) Surveillance (forms of information seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience’s motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus “internal” goal orientation, and emotional stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted, these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge, and understanding
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings
3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, satisfaction
4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends
5. Tension release, escape, and diversion

Incongruously, McQuail’s (1983) classifying common reasons for media use:

- Finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings and in the world
- Seeking advice on practical matters
- Satisfying curiosity and general interest
- Learning; self-education
- Gaining a sense of security through media
- Finding reinforcement for personal values
- Finding models of behavior
- Identifying with valued others (in the media)
- Gaining insight into oneself
