The CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States and the prevalence of advertising were something with no correlative experience to the advertising industry in the United States (Dennis, 2002, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical research as being indistinguishable from political (Horkheimer & Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not agree on the scope of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Doblin, and others, several of which found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood movies must have had some influence on developing his thoughts on culture since the Hollywood system inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany. These preconditionsAdorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project....

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 142). Examples of this, not specified by Adorno, were the Hollywood production system, and the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real art to make and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only serve to reinforce the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles as an example of someone who was allowed to work outside the system and make independent films (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 101). Ultimately, focusing on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, Theodor W. Adorno criticized the culture industry for being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture. He defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 101). It was not high art tp industry, but modernism. Although he provides no overt Marxist analysis.
