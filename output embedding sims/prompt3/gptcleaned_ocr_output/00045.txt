It is well accepted that communication theories developed through the study of Psychology over the past 100 years are illuminated by valuable insights as well as exploring more untilled fields.

In two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of media effects research, the uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally stemmed from a functionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler, Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory of communication aligns with messages towards people. For example, it is used in the Thermic Syringe that "the mass media has a direct, immediate, and influential impact upon audiences by 'injecting' information into the minds of the masses" (Watson & Hill, 1997, p. 105). Functional theories influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift occurred which rediscovered the bond in media and led to the establishment of uses and gratification.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became interested in different radio programs, such as soap operas and daily newspapers (Lazarsfeld & 1944, 1949; et al. research, researchers developed a list of functions served either by the specific content or by the media itself (Katz et al., 1974). They found that media satisfies their listeners with advice, support, or occasions for emotional release (Lazarsfeld & Henry, 1948); rather than just providing information, newspapers were also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics of conversation, and a structure to their daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of uses (1944) marked the term "gratifications."

The same prevailing theme from the late 1950s till 1970s when television was predominant when it was rediscovered during that era. Among gratifications research, Elihu Katz is the most well-known figure of the approach. Elihu Katz served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During his teaching career, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew University. Invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged with broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about broadcasting and television in leisure, culture, and communication from the 1970s to 1990s (UPENN, 2001). In 1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania and also directed its experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral students.

Katz's mentor at Columbia University was Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one of the pioneers of gratification. Their cooperation produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the functional theory. Later, Katz introduced the uses and gratification approach when he came up with the notion that people adapt the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas (1973), a subject which is known as the uses and gratifications research was explored. They viewed the mass media as a means by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch, and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which were entitled "The Uses of Mass Communication," taking a more humanistic approach in looking at media. They suggest that media users seek information from a source that best fulfills the needs of the user and they have alternate choices to select from (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They suggest that media
