Like many other semioticians, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics. The semiotic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set of communication, indifferent to the material of the signals which compose it. Within the social dimension of langue, the social convention or value shared throughout a society is the key.

On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression and is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual is based on shared conventions, the structure.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract that one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. Because a language is a system of contractual values, it resists modifications from a single individual and is thus a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaker can use the code of the language to express personal thoughts. Speech corresponds to an individual act and not a pure creation (Barthes, 1967, pp. 44-15).

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is the concept or meaning expressed through the form, called the signifier, which is the external part of language. The relation between the concept/meaning and the external form is not destined but arbitrary. Meaning is produced through a process of combination of signs along the syntagmatic (e.g., a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system (Barker, 2002, p. 29). Despite various possibilities in selecting signs within the paradigmatic field, the selection is regulated by the consensus of linguistic community.

For example, consider the sentence "I went to the theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is a combination of signs that can be substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic field. Through the syntagmatic and paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs derive their meaning through a structural convention and are understood in a particular context.

"It is central to Saussure's theory that individual linguistic signs acquire their meaning through the structural convention of relations between signs" (Saussure, 1960, p. 37). This demonstrates the importance of the relationship between signs, such as red, green, amber, etc., and how they are transformed into a sequence generating meaning through cultural and individual contexts.
