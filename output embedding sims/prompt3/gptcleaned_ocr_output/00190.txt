RETURN TO GERMANY

Return to Germany

Published with the permission of Horkheimer in 1941.

The Institute relocated to Frankfurt in the 1940s in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. It opened in its new home in Frankfurt, and Deane became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt.

Adorno protested against the involvement of the Wacker Foundation in a study about the implications of mass culture. Observers found it strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in the study.

Adorno discussed the premises in 1951 and later wrote about a universal pseudo-culture in the United States. He also wrote about acceptable cultural practices in the industry.

Marcuse's analysis of capitalist society focused on social control mechanisms and the integration of individuals into mass society. He questioned the distinction between information and entertainment in mass media.

Marcuse wondered how individuals could liberate themselves from the dominant ideology in society. He maintained an oppositional stance but was not an activist.

In 1961, Friedrich Pollock reported to Adorno and Horkheimer about the work being published. They continued to negotiate with individuals for the work to be republished.
