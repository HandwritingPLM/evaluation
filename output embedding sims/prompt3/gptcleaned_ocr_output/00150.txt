1 Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to understand the creation of the concept, it can be examined chronologically, from its inception through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical reproduction of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno became in effect Benjamin's only pupil. After Benjamin's death, "it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy" (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and was operating there. The Nazis' rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would be forced to leave Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jurgen Habermas noted, the fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the experiences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001). Adorno considered himself an outsider, never integrating into the British academic scene. As the commodification of culture and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda influenced culture, Adorno and Benjamin debated mass culture, since film and radio were considered propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay "The Regression in Listening" is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." Adorno condemned the mechanical reproduction of culture, as he believed it destroyed the aura of the original and emphasized listening as an escape from standardization and the destruction of cultural experiences tied to class distinctions. To Adorno, the aura of the original was essential, as it represented emancipation from hierarchical tastes. The general attitude of the industry was nothing but the destruction of the aura, succeeding only in establishing a relationship of domination. Adorno, who had successfully continued working in the United States, further developed these ideas in collaboration with Max Horkheimer. In 1938, Max Horkheimer, who had accepted a position at Columbia University as Director of the Institute of Social Research and founded the Radio Research Project, accepted a position with the University of California, Berkeley. For his part, Adorno, although looking forward to working with Horkheimer, believed that radio was only an image of a live experience. However, in 1941, reiterating his opposition to the medium, Adorno became shocked at the degree to which the masses consumed culture through radio. Furthermore, he was introduced to the New York intellectual scene, where he and Horkheimer became friends.
