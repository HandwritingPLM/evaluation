Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics.

To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two axes: the former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue refers to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal itself; as opposed to it, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 1967, p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimensions: langue is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level; it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not to a pure creation.

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. Saussure argues that "language does not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, "meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system". 

As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, signs are understood as a social convention organized to relate to each other. Thus, meaning is organized through the relations between signs.
