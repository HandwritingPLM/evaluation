generating propaganda in influencing the minds of the public. Bernays himself made a statement regarding his approach to public relations and propaganda. He said, "Engineering implies planning. And it is in careful planning, more than anything else, that effective propaganda is based" (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays emphasizes the importance of public opinion in the formation of public relations strategies. Additionally, Bernays' theories offer a different perspective from Lippmann's viewpoints on public opinion. While Lippmann believed in manipulating public opinion, Bernays cautioned against this approach. He claimed, "The public mind can be molded at will or dictated to" (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays suggested that in attempting to influence the public, a business should strive for amicable and mutually beneficial relationships with the public. The business must explain its aims and objectives to the public in clear terms. Bernays elaborates on these ideas in his work "Public Relations" (1952). Bernays presents public relations as a tool for engaging with the public and persuading them, rather than simply manipulating them through propaganda. 

Bernays emphasizes the importance of public relations in helping citizens understand society, evaluate different viewpoints, and take action to modify conditions that affect them. While Bernays acknowledges the power of society and the potential for public manipulation, he also emphasizes the benefits of public relations in fostering mutual understanding and constructive dialogue. Bernays' view of the public is more positive compared to Lippmann's, as he believes in the potential for collaboration and communication between the public and organizations. 

In conclusion, the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul have significant implications for understanding the influence of the media on public opinion. These theories have paved the way for further research on media effects and public manipulation. The work of scholars like Iyengar, Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw has expanded our understanding of media influence and communication strategies. Overall, these theories offer valuable insights into the complex relationship between the media, public opinion, and society.
