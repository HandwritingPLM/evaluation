Genesis of "The Culture Industry"

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as it went through its generation, to its subsequent impact as it's received, the concept can be examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions. The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical reproduction of popular music, but also extends to Hollywood movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy. The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland and the Institute began operating there.
