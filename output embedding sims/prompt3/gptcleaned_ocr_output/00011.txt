Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Understanding the public and the importance of attention-generating propaganda in influencing opinions (Blumler, 1967; Blumer, 1969; p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies an organized and shannered anties 5 eneceesible planning. And it is careful planning that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and se Solebury, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays' theories also represent a different view of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass that can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that to successfully influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be based on and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the public in terms that the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays, 1952, p. 9). Bernays' view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of society but also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affect us, to evaluate efforts being made by others, and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of public opinion. Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that the public is able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more recent research that is meant to help understand the influence of the media on the public. With work by Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive view of the media has been developed. The public has now been made aware of various notions like agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects that these techniques can have on their audiences. The theorists discussed in this paper have provided a starting point for future research on the effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of as well and McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in this paper is important for understanding the media, the manipulation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and others were formed, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
