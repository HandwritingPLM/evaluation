Like many other structuralist scholars, Saussure, the linguistic el; he argued that leoge.Knot ose ay speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter Ye a ve city ave of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material aet eos it; as opposed to it, speech (parole) covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1967, p. 13). Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure we call langue, is the social convention or value shared throughout society which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution. In contrast to language which is both an institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to an individual act and not to a pure creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Saussure distinguishes the language as the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language, for example, the forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "I call signified (signifi√©) and designate the whole, to the concept and the sound-image" (Saussure, 1959, in Barker). Both have the advantage of being able to distinguish themselves from each other and from the whole of which they are parts. Saussure argues that language does not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects but constructs it. According to Saussure, meaning is produced through a series of conceptual axes, the syntagmatic (e.g. a sentence), and the paradigmatic (e.g. a field of possible signifiers). In a sentence, the syntagmatic means a linear combination of signs, while the paradigmatic means a selection of signs within the system. Saussure emphasizes that signs within the syntagmatic order can be replaced with one another, regulated by the consensus of the linguistic community.

Under the following - the paradigmatic, let's consider an example: the meaning of a sentence is established through a linear combination of signs in the syntagmatic, such as 'a boy ate ice cream and apple' being substituted for by 'a girl ate cake and pie' in the paradigmatic. Saussure emphasizes that signs do not make sense through the syntagmatic. Crucially, signifiers generate meaning by reference to each other and are organized through the relations between signs within a particular context. Meaning is meaningful in relation to difference, according to Saussure's argument, baie la s in uence which is used within a particular context.
