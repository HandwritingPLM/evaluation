1. The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

Adorno said that the development of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something which he had not experienced elsewhere. The closest thing in Adorno's experience to the advertising industry was propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122). Adorno later alluded to his experience with the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adorno's dissatisfaction with the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop the idea of the culture industry. Because of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University, Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until November 1941. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Döblin, and Bertolt Brecht, several of whom found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno was part of this intellectual community, whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood movies, must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany. These preconditions – Adorno's interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industry – are all important to understand his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

Adorno did not consider popular culture, film, or radio to present itself as art. They were instead trash intentionally produced, as Adorno referred to as Fordist. Adorno did illustrate that film and radio did not bother to present an ideology to legitimize the business based on what he called the techniques used by Henry Ford were instead implemented in centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl, 1995). Adorno specified that the Hollywood production system or the Princeton Radio Research Project movies represented the work (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002). He noted that there were no challenges to the system. For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio was a business, and this, in turn, became capitalism, which mass produced a production based on the technical business (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002). The business of mass production ensured that the system would emerge in the system.

Adorno, as an adversary, was presenting as an alternative to the culture, a defence of high art overall. He noted that he specifically defined avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture Adorno's (Horkheimer and Adorno 2002, p. 95). The idea of an opposing force to the culture industry was presented by Adorno, “A modernist”, although he agrees and provides the overt Marxist analysis instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system will always be enjoyment or amusement (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002). He specically defined avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture in Adorno's' criticizing as being a defence of high overall a great specifically defined avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture ally (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 101).'
