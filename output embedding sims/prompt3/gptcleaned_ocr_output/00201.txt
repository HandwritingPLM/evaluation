It is a value of empirical studies, and Adorno's work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop the idea of the culture industry.

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in Europe, and what he observed in the United States was something with no correlative overseas. Adorno was later to allude to his experience with the project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical results, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political. 

It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not leave the project.

Movies under the Hollywood production system, according to Horkheimer and Adorno, did not bother to present themselves as art. They were instead intentionally produced in a formulaic manner that was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist principles. This was seen as a real change to the system, ultimately rendering any opposition and make it its own, ultimately.

Examples of this, not specified by Adorno, were the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Project and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants be work. Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge.
